<p>I want to use a track-bar to change a form's opacity.</p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

<pre><code>decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000;
this.Opacity = trans;
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to build it, I get this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double'.</p>

<p>I tried making <code>trans</code> a <code>double</code>, but then the control doesn't work. This code has worked fine for me in VB.NET in the past. </p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>I am aware that in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET</a> there are three timer types (see <em><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164015.aspx">Comparing the Timer Classes in the .NET Framework Class Library</a></em>). I have chosen a threaded timer as the other types can drift if the main thread is busy, and I need this to be reliable.</p>

<p>The way this timer works in the control of the timer is put on another thread so it can always tick along with the work begin completed on the parent thread when it is not busy.</p>

<p>The issue with this timer in a console application is that while the timer is ticking along on another thread the main thread is not doing anything so the application closes.</p>

<p>I tried adding a <code>while true</code> loop, but then the main thread is too busy when the timer does go off.</p>

<p>You can use something like <code>Console.ReadLine()</code> to block the main thread, so other background threads (like timer threads) will still work. You may also use an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.autoresetevent.aspx">AutoResetEvent</a> to block the execution, then (when you need to) you can call Set() method on that AutoResetEvent object to release the main thread. Also ensure that your reference to Timer object doesn't go out of scope and garbage collected.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a <code>DataTable</code> with a <code>Name</code> column. I want to have a collection of the unique names ordered alphabetically. The following query ignores the order by clause.</p>

<pre><code>var names =
    (from DataRow dr in dataTable.Rows
    orderby (string)dr["Name"]
    select (string)dr["Name"]).Distinct();
</code></pre>

<p>Why does the <code>orderby</code> not get enforced?</p>

<p><strong>The problem is that the Distinct
 operator does not grant that it will
 maintain the original order of
 values.</strong></p>

<p>So your query will need to work like this</p>

<pre><code>var names = (from DataRow dr in dataTable.Rows
             select (string)dr["Name"]).Distinct().OrderBy( name =&gt; name );
</code></pre>

<p>It sounds like <code>this.Opacity</code> is a double value, and the compiler doesn't like you trying to cram a decimal value into it.</p>

<p>If you use a return type of <code>IEnumerable</code>, you can return your <strong>query</strong> variable directly.</p>

<p>What is the "purist" or "correct" way to access an object's properties from within an object method that is not a getter/setter method?</p>

<p>I know that from outside of the object you should use a getter/setter, but from within would you just do:</p>

<p>Java:</p>

<pre><code>String property = this.property;
</code></pre>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>$property = $this-&gt;property;
</code></pre>

<p>or would you do:</p>

<p>Java:</p>

<pre><code>String property = this.getProperty();
</code></pre>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>$property = $this-&gt;getProperty();
</code></pre>

<p>Forgive me if my Java is a little off, it's been a year since I programmed in Java...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...</p>

<p>This has religious war potential, but it seems to me that if you're using a getter/setter, you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road (e.g. somebody adds code to a setter that <em>needs</em> to run every time that property is set, and the property is being set internally w/o that setter being called).</p>
<p>It depends on how the property is used. For example, say you have a student object that has a name property. You could use your Get method to pull the name from the database, if it hasn't been retrieved already. This way you are reducing unnecessary calls to the database.</p>

<p>Now let's say you have a private integer counter in your object that counts the number of times the name has been called. You may want to not use the Get method from inside the object because it would produce an invalid count.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Am I just going overboard here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps ;)</p>

<p>Another approach would be to utilize a private/protected method to actually do the getting (caching/db/etc), and a public wrapper for it that increments the count:</p>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>public function getName() {<br>    $this-&gt;incrementNameCalled();<br>    return $this-&gt;_getName();<br>}<br><br>protected function _getName() {<br>    return $this-&gt;name;<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>and then from within the object itself:</p>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>$name = $this-&gt;_getName();<br></code></pre>

<p>This way you can still use that first argument for something else (like sending a flag for whether or not to used cached data here perhaps). </p>
<p>As stated in some of the comments: Sometimes you should, sometimes you shouldn't. The great part about private variables is that you are able to see all the places they are used when you change something. If your getter/setter does something you need, use it. If it doesn't matter you decide.</p>

<p>The opposite case could be made that if you use the getter/setter and somebody changes the getter/setter they have to analyze all the places the getter and setter is used internally to see if it messes something up. </p>
<p>Does anyone know of a good way to compress or decompress files and folders in C# quickly? Handling large files might be necessary.</p>

<p>I've always used the SharpZip Library.</p>

<p><a href="http://sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/Download.aspx">Here's a link</a></p>

<p>You can use a <a href="http://sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/" rel="nofollow">3rd-party library such as SharpZip</a> as Tom pointed out.</p>

<p>Another way (without going 3rd-party) is to use the Windows Shell API. You'll need to set a reference to the Microsoft Shell Controls and Automation COM library in your C# project. Gerald Gibson has an example at:</p>

<p><s><a href="http://geraldgibson.net/dnn/Home/CZipFileCompression/tabid/148/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://geraldgibson.net/dnn/Home/CZipFileCompression/tabid/148/Default.aspx</a></s> </p>

<p>Personally, I feel like it's important to remain consistent.  If you have getters and setters, use them.  The only time I would access a field directly is when the accessor has a lot of overhead.  It may feel like you're bloating your code unnecessarily, but it can certainly save a whole lot of headache in the future.  The classic example:</p>

<p>Later on, you may desire to change the way that field works.  Maybe it should be calculated on-the-fly or maybe you would like to use a different type for the backing store.  If you are accessing properties directly, a change like that can break an awful lot of code in one swell foop.</p>
<p>I want to print HTML from a C# web service.  The Web Browser control is overkill, and does not function well in a service environment, nor does it function well on a system with very tight security constraints.  Is there any sort of free <code>.NET</code> library that will support the printing of a basic HTML page?  Here is the code I have so far, which does not run properly.</p>

<pre><code>public void PrintThing(string document)
{
    if (Thread.CurrentThread.GetApartmentState() != ApartmentState.STA)
    {
        Thread thread =
            new Thread((ThreadStart) delegate { PrintDocument(document); });
        thread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);
        thread.Start();
    }
    else
    {
        PrintDocument(document);
    }
}

protected void PrintDocument(string document)
{
    WebBrowser browser = new WebBrowser();
    browser.DocumentText = document;
    while (browser.ReadyState != WebBrowserReadyState.Complete)
    {
        Application.DoEvents();
    }
    browser.Print();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine when called from UI-type threads, but nothing happens when called from a service-type thread.  Changing <code>Print()</code> to <code>ShowPrintPreviewDialog()</code> yields the following IE script error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error: 'dialogArguments.___IE_PrintType' is null or not an object<br />
  URL: res://ieframe.dll/preview.dlg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a small empty print preview dialog appears.</p>

<p>One of the fun parts of multi-cultural programming is number formats.</p>

<ul>
<li>Americans use 10,000.50</li>
<li>Germans use 10.000,50</li>
<li>French use 10 000,50</li>
</ul>

<p>My first approach would be to take the string, parse it backwards, until I encounter a separator and use this as my decimal separator. There is an obvious flaw with that: 10.000 would be interpreted as 10.</p>

<p>Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others. If I only have one, check if it occurs more than once and discard it if it does. If it only appears once, check if it has 3 digits after it. If yes, discard it, otherwise use it as decimal separator.</p>

<p>The obvious "best solution" would be to detect the User's culture or Browser, but that does not work if you have a Frenchman using an en-US Windows/Browser.</p>

<p>Does the .net Framework contain some mythical black magic floating point parser that is better than <code>Double.(Try)Parse()</code> in trying to auto-detect the number format?</p>

<p>I don't know the ASP.NET side of the problem but .NET has a pretty powerful class: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.aspx">System.Globalization.CultureInfo</a>. You can use the following code to parse a string containing a double value:</p>

<pre><code>double d = double.Parse("100.20", CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);<br>//  -- OR --<br>double d = double.Parse("100.20", CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture);<br></code></pre>

<p>If ASP.NET somehow (i.e. using HTTP Request headers) passes current user's CultureInfo to either CultureInfo.CurrentCulture or CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture, these will work fine.</p>
<p>You can't please everyone.  If I enter ten as 10.000, and someone enters ten thousand as 10.000, you cannot handle that without some knowledge of the culture of the input.  Detect the culture somehow (browser, system setting - what is the use case?  ASP?  Internal app, or open to the world?), or provide an example of the expected formatting, and use the most lenient parser you can.  Probably something like:</p>

<pre><code>double d = Double.Parse("5,000.00", NumberStyles.Any, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);<br></code></pre>
<p>I think the best you can do in this case is to take their input and then show them what you think they meant. If they disagree, show them the format you're expecting and get them to enter it again.</p>
<p>I have a little game written in C#. It uses a database as back-end. It's 
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game">trading card game</a>, and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script.</p>

<p>What I mean is that I essentially have an interface, <code>ICard</code>, which a card class implements (<code>public class Card056 : ICard</code>) and which contains function that are called by the game.</p>

<p>Now, to make the thing maintainable/moddable, I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card, I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh, without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).</p>

<p>Is that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it, etc.</p>

<pre><code>ICard Cards[current] = new MyGame.CardLibrary.Card056();
Cards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState);
</code></pre>

<p>The language is C#, but extra bonus if it's possible to write the script in any .NET language.</p>

<p>I have been trying to implement Win32's <code>MessageBox</code> using GTK. The app using SDL/OpenGL, so this isn't a GTK app. </p>

<p>I handle the initialisation (<code>gtk_init</code>) sort of stuff inside the <code>MessageBox</code> function as follows:</p>

<pre><code>int MessageBox(HWND hwnd, const char* text, const char* caption, UINT type)
{
    GtkWidget *window = NULL;
    GtkWidget *dialog = NULL;

    gtk_init(&amp;gtkArgc, &amp;gtkArgv);
    window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    g_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(window), "delete_event", G_CALLBACK(delete_event), NULL);
    g_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(window), "destroy", G_CALLBACK(destroy), NULL);
    // gcallback calls gtk_main_quit()
    gtk_init_add((GtkFunction)gcallback, NULL);

    if (type &amp; MB_YESNO) {
        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT, GTK_MESSAGE_QUESTION, GTK_BUTTONS_YES_NO, text);
    } else {
        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT, GTK_MESSAGE_INFO, GTK_BUTTONS_OK, text);
    }

    gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(dialog), caption);
    gint result = gtk_dialog_run(GTK_DIALOG(dialog));

    gtk_main();

    gtk_widget_destroy(dialog);

    if (type &amp; MB_YESNO) {
        switch (result) {
        default:
        case GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT:
        case GTK_RESPONSE_NO:
            return IDNO;
            break;
        case GTK_RESPONSE_YES:
            return IDYES;
            break;
        }
    }

    return IDOK;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I am by no means an experienced GTK programmer, and I realise that I'm probably doing something(s) horribly wrong.</p>

<p>However, my problem is that the last dialog popped up with this function stays around until the process exits. Any ideas?</p>

<ul>
<li>What's the optimal level of concurrency that the C++ implementation of BerkeleyDB can reasonably support?</li>
<li>How many threads can I have hammering away at the DB before throughput starts to suffer because of resource contention?</li>
</ul>

<p>I've read the manual and know how to set the number of locks, lockers, database page size, etc., but I'd just like some advice from someone who has real-world experience with BDB concurrency.</p>

<p>My application is pretty simple, I'll be doing gets and puts of records that are about 1KB each. No cursors, no deleting.</p>

<p>I often have to sort a dictionary, consisting of keys &amp; values, by value. For example, I have a hash of words and respective frequencies, that I want to order by frequency.</p>

<p>There is a <code>SortedList</code> which is good for a single value (say frequency), that I want to map it back to the word.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7fta44c.aspx">SortedDictionary</a> orders by key, not value. Some resort to a <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/lookupcollection.aspx">custom class</a>, but is there a cleaner way?</p>

<p>I know that Visual Studio itself (at least in 2003 version) references the IE dll directly to render the "Design View".</p>

<p>It may be worth looking into that.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I can't think of anything beyond the Web Browser control.</p>
<p>Looking around, and using some C# 3.0 features we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;string,int&gt; item in keywordCounts.OrderBy(key=&gt; key.Value))
{ 
    // do something with item.Key and item.Value
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the cleanest way I've seen and is similar to the Ruby way of handling hashes.</p>

<p>On a high level, you have no other choice then to walk through the whole Dictionary and look at each value.</p>

<p>Maybe this helps:

<p>I am working on a collection of classes used for video playback and recording. I have one main class which acts like the public interface, with methods like <code>play()</code>, <code>stop()</code>, <code>pause()</code>, <code>record()</code> etc... Then I have workhorse classes which do the video decoding and video encoding. </p>

<p>I just learned about the existence of nested classes in C++, and I'm curious to know what programmers think about using them. I am a little wary and not really sure what the benefits/drawbacks are, but they seem (according to the book I'm reading) to be used in cases such as mine.</p>

<p>The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.</p>

<p>I'm about to build a piece of a project that will need to construct and post an XML document to a web service and I'd like to do it in Python, as a means to expand my skills in it.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, whilst I know the XML model fairly well in .NET, I'm uncertain what the pros and cons are of the XML models in Python.  </p>

<p>Anyone have experience doing XML processing in Python? Where would you suggest I start? The XML files I'll be building will be fairly simple.</p>

<p><a href="http://diveintopython.net/xml_processing/">Dive Into Python</a> has a chapter. Can't vouch for how good it would be though.</p>

<p>Personally, I've played with several of the built-in options on an XML-heavy project and have settled on <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-xml.dom.pulldom.html">pulldom</a> as the best choice for less complex documents.</p>

<p>Especially for small simple stuff, I like the event-driven theory of parsing rather than setting up a whole slew of callbacks for a relatively simple structure.  <a href="http://www.prescod.net/python/pulldom.html">Here is a good quick discussion of how to use the API</a>.</p>

<p>What I like: you can handle the parsing in a <code>for</code> loop rather than using callbacks.  You also delay full parsing (the "pull" part) and only get additional detail when you call <code>expandNode()</code>.  This satisfies my general requirement for "responsible" efficiency without sacrificing ease of use and simplicity.</p>

<P>You could use any of the DLR languages, which provide a way to really easily host your own scripting platform. However, you don't have to use a scripting language for this.

<p>What is the meaning of the <em>Java warning</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type safety: The cast from Object to List is actually checking against the erased type List</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get this warning when I try to cast an Object to a type with generic information, such as in the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Object object = getMyList();
List&lt;Integer&gt; list = (List&lt;Integer&gt;) object;
</code></pre>

<p>This warning is there because Java is not actually storing type information at run-time in an object that uses generics.  Thus, if <code>object</code> is actually a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>, there will be no <code>ClassCastException</code> at run-time except until an item is accessed from the list that doesn't match the generic type defined in the variable.  </p>

<p>This can cause further complications if items are added to the list, with this incorrect generic type information.  Any code still holding a reference to the list but with the correct generic type information will now have an inconsistent list.  </p>

<p>To remove the warning, try:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;?&gt; list = (List&lt;?&gt;) object;
</code></pre>

<p>However, note that you will not be able to use certain methods such as add because the compiler doesn't know if you are trying to add an object of incorrect type.  The above will work in a lot of situations, but if you have to use add, or some similarly restricted method, you will just have to suffer the yellow underline in Eclipse (or a <code>SuppressWarning</code> annotation).</p>

<p>Also, the flow doesn't seem quite right.  <code>gtk_main()</code> starts the GTK main loop, which blocks until something exits it.  <code>gtk_dialog_run()</code> also starts a main loop, but it exits as soon as one of the buttons is clicked.</p>

<p>I think it might be enough for you to remove the <code>gtk_init_add()</code> and <code>gtk_main()</code> calls, and simply deal with the return value.  Also the <code>gtk_widget_destroy()</code> call is unnecessary, as the dialog window is automatically destroyed when gtk_dialog_run() returns.</p>

<p>I was just sitting at my local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders_%28UK%29">Borders</a> sipping coffee and reading <em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1430209879">More Joel on Software</a></em> (for free) when I came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a> saying something about a particular type of programmer knowing the difference between an int and an Integer in Java/C# (Object Oriented Programming Languages).</p>

<p>After a quick 'brain check,' I realized, to my dismay, that I didn't know the answer.</p>

<p><strong>In Java,</strong> the 'int' type is a primitive , whereas the 'Integer' type is an object.</p>

<p><strong>In C#,</strong> the 'int' type is the same as <code>System.Int32</code> and is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1ax56ch.aspx">a value type</a> (ie more like the java 'int'). An integer (just like any other value types) can be <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yz2be5wk.aspx">boxed</a> ("wrapped") into an object. </p>

<hr>

<p>The differences between objects and primitives are somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but to summarize: </p>

<p><strong>Objects</strong> provide facilities for polymorphism, are passed by reference (or more accurately have references passed by value), and are allocated from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation">heap</a>. Conversely, <strong>primitives</strong> are immutable types that are passed by value and are often allocated from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation">stack</a>.</p>

<p>Well, in Java an int is a primitive while an Integer is an Object. Meaning, if you made a new Integer:</p>

<pre><code>Integer i = new Integer(6);
</code></pre>

<p>You could call some method on i:</p>

<pre><code>String s = i.toString();//sets s the string representation of i
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas with an int:</p>

<pre><code>int i = 6;
</code></pre>

<p>You cannot call any methods on it, because it is simply a primitive. So:</p>

<pre><code>String s = i.toString();//will not work!!!
</code></pre>

<p>would produce an error, because int is not an object.</p>

<p>int is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others). I'm not 100% sure, but I'm thinking that the Integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property (like the toString() method for example). So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).</p>

<p>I know that Java isn't C, but since I've never programmed in C this is the closest I could come to the answer. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>In C#, int is just an <strong><em>alias</em></strong> for <code>System.Int32</code>, string for <code>System.String</code>, double for <code>System.Double</code> etc...</p>

<p>Personally I prefer int, string, double, etc. because they don't require a <code>using System;</code> statement :) A silly reason, I know...</p>

<p>I'm writing a CMS application in PHP and one of the requirements is that it must be able to interface with the customer's Exchange server.  I've written up this functionality a few times before and have always used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> to do it, but now I'm leaning away from that.</p>

<p>I will be running the site on IIS OR Apache (no preference) on Windows server 2008.  A few things I would need to do include adding contacts to a given user's address book, sending emails as a given user and running reports on contacts for a user.</p>

<p>All of this is pretty easy to do with WebDAV, but if there is a better way that doesn't require any functionality that is likely to be deprecated any time soon.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Justin, I love the idea of using com objects, I just worry about maintaining a 3rd product to make everything work...</p>

<p>John, I can write a web service in C# to interface with for these functions and access it with my PHP app, but it's also a little bit out of the way.</p>

<p>Can anyone show me where I'm being silly?</p>

<p>There are several ways to iterate over a result set, which way is the best?</p>

<p>There are three ways to iterate over a result set.  The best way in terms of both
readability and performance is usually to use the built-in cursor iterator.</p>

<pre>curs.execute('select * from people')
for row in curs:
    print row
</pre>

<p>You can fetch all the rows into a list, but this can have some bad
side effects if the result set is large.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have to wait for the entire result set to be returned to
your client process.</p></li>
<li><p>You may eat up a lot of memory in your client to hold
the built-up list.</p></li>
<li><p>It may take a while for Python to construct and deconstruct the
list which you are going to immediately discard anyways.</p></li>
</ul>

<pre>for row in curs.fetchall():
    print row
</pre>

<p>Finally, you can loop over the result set fetching one row at 
a time.  In general, there's no particular advantage in doing this over
using the iterator.  If there is something in your programming logic
that seems to indicate there is an advantage in doing this, perhaps
you should reconsider your programming logic.</p>

<p></p><pre>row = curs.fetchone()
while row:
    print row
    row = curs.fetchone()<pre></pre></pre>
<p>Hmm, ok.  I'd suggest code like this, then:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {<br>    int type;<br>    int result;<br>} DialogData;<br><br>static gboolean<br>display_dialog(gpointer user_data)<br>{<br>    DialogData *dialog_data = user_data;<br>    GtkWidget *dialog;<br><br>    if (dialog_data-&gt;type &amp; MB_YESNO)<br>        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(...);<br>    else<br>        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(...);<br><br>    // Set title, etc.<br><br>    dialog_data-&gt;result = gtk_dialog_run(...);<br><br>    gtk_main_quit();  // Quits the main loop run in MessageBox()<br><br>    return FALSE;<br>}<br><br>int MessageBox(...)<br>{<br>    DialogData dialog_data;<br><br>    dialog_data.type = type;<br><br>    gtk_idle_add(display_dialog, &amp;dialog_data);<br><br>    gtk_main();<br><br>    // Do stuff based on dialog_data.result<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>The struct is because you need to pass around a couple pieces of data.  The <code>gtk_idle_add()</code> call adds a method to be run when the main loop is running and idle, and the <code>FALSE</code> return value from the <code>display_dialog()</code> call means that it's only run once.  After we get the result from the dialog, we quit the main loop.  That'll cause the <code>gtk_main()</code> in your main <code>MessageBox()</code> method to return, and you'll be able to access the result from there.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>I'll add to the excellent answers given above, and talk about boxing and unboxing, and how this applies to Java (although C# has it too). I'll use just Java terminology, because I am more <em>au fait</em> with that.</p>

<p>As the answers mentioned, <code>int</code> is just a number (called the <em>unboxed</em> type), whereas <code>Integer</code> is an object (which contains the number, hence a <em>boxed</em> type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on <code>int</code>), you cannot store <code>int</code> or other non-object types in collections (<code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.</p>

<p>Java 5 onwards have something called <em>auto-boxing</em> and <em>auto-unboxing</em> which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:</p>

<pre><code>Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(n);<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return queue.remove();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):</p>

<pre><code>Deque queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n));<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations <em>do</em> happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.</p>

<p>The Outlook API is a way of automating Outlook rather than connecting to Exchange directly. I have previously taken this approach in a C# application and it does work although can be buggy.</p>

<p>If you wish to connect directly to the Exchange server you will need to research extended MAPI.</p>

<p>I write a SOAP server that receives XML requests, and creates XML responses.  (Unfortunately, it's not my project, so it's closed source, but that's another problem).</p>

<p>It turned out for me that creating (SOAP) XML documents is fairly simple, if you have a data structure that "fits" the schema.</p>

<p>I keep the envelope, since the response envelope is (almost) the same as the request envelope.  Then, since my data structure is a (possibly nested) dictionary, I create a string that turns this dictionary into &lt;key>value&lt;/key> items.  </p>

<p>This is a task that recursion makes simple, and I end up with the right structure.  This is all done in python code, and is currently fast enough for production use.</p>

<p>You can also (relatively) easily build lists as well, although depending upon your client, you may hit problems unless you give length hints.</p>

<p>For me, this was much simpler, since a dictionary is a much easier way of working than some custom class.  For the books, generating XML is much easier than parsing!</p>
<p>I don't remember whether I was dreaming or not but I seem to recall there being a function which allowed something like,</p>

<pre><code>foo in iter_attr(array of python objects, attribute name)</code></pre>

<p>I've looked over the docs but this kind of thing doesn't fall under any obvious listed headers</p>
<p>No, you were not dreaming.  Python has a pretty excellent list comprehension system that lets you manipulate lists pretty elegantly, and depending on exactly what you want to accomplish, this can be done a couple of ways.  In essence, what you're doing is saying "For item in list if criteria.matches", and from that you can just iterate through the results or dump the results into a new list.</p>

<p>I'm going to crib an example from <a href="http://diveintopython.net/functional_programming/filtering_lists.html" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a> here, because it's pretty elegant and they're smarter than I am.  Here they're getting a list of files in a directory, then filtering the list for all files that match a regular expression criteria.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    files = os.listdir(path)                               
    test = re.compile("test\.py$", re.IGNORECASE)          
    files = [f for f in files if test.search(f)]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You could do this without regular expressions, for your example, for anything where your expression at the end returns true for a match.  There are other options like using the filter() function, but if I were going to choose, I'd go with this.</p>

<p>I think <code>NUnit</code> <strong>is</strong> your best bet. With <code>TestDriven.NET</code>, you get great integration within <code>VS.NET</code>. (Resharper also has a unit test runner if you're using it).  <code>NUnit</code> it simple to use and follows an established paradigm. You'll also find plenty of projects/tutorials/guides using it which always helps.</p>

<p>Your other main choice is probably MBUnit, which is more and more position itself as the <code>BDD</code> framework of choice (in conjunction with Gallio <a href="http://www.gallio.org">http://www.gallio.org</a>).</p>

<p>I think:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/python<br>bar in dict(Foo)<br></code></pre>

<p>Is what you are thinking of.  When trying to see if a certain key exists within a dictionary in python (python's version of a hash table) there are two ways to check.  First is the <strong><code>has_key()</code></strong> method attached to the dictionary and second is the example given above.  It will return a boolean value.</p>

<p>That should answer your question.</p>

<p>And now a little off topic to tie this in to the <em>list comprehension</em> answer previously given (for a bit more clarity).  <em>List Comprehensions</em> construct a list from a basic <em>for loop</em> with modifiers.  As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the <code>in dict</code> language construct in a _list comprehension_:</p>

<p>Say you have a two dimensional dictionary <strong><code>foo</code></strong> and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key <strong><code>bar</code></strong>.  A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a <em>list comprehension</em> with a conditional as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/python<br>baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value])<br></code></pre>

<p>Note the <strong><code>if bar in value</code></strong> at the end of the statement<strong>, this is a modifying clause which tells the <em>list comprehension</em> to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.</strong>  In this case <strong><code>baz</code></strong> is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000" rel="nofollow">docs.python.org tutorials</a> and at <a href="http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk" rel="nofollow">secnetix.de</a>, both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> view points to a function, which can be a problem if you want to change only a bit of functionality. Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.</p>

<p>For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...</p>

<p>One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea? </p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.ucwords.php" rel="nofollow">ucwords()</a></p>

<p>example:</p>

<pre><code>$HelloWorld = ucwords('hello world');
</code></pre>

<p>What I was thinking of can be achieved using list comprehensions, but I thought that there was a function that did this in a slightly neater way.</p>

<p>i.e. 'bar' is a list of objects, all of which have the attribute 'id'</p>

<p>The mythical functional way:</p>

<pre><code>foo = 12<br>foo in iter_attr(bar, 'id')</code></pre>

<p>The list comprehension way:</p>

<pre><code>foo = 12<br>foo in [obj.id for obj in bar]</code></pre>

<p>In retrospect the list comprehension way is pretty neat anyway.</p>
<p>Without using a ready-made function, a super-simple low-level algorithm to convert a string to title case:</p>

<p></p><pre><code>convert first character to uppercase.<br>for each character in string,<br>  if the previous character is whitespace,<br>    convert character to uppercase.<br></code></pre><code></code><p></p>

<p>This asssumes the "convert character to uppercase" will do that correctly regardless of whether or not the character is case-sensitive (e.g., '+').</p>
<p>One may not always know the Type of an object at compile-time, but may need to create an instance of the Type.  How do you get a new object instance from a Type?</p>
<p>One implementation of this problem is to attempt to call the parameter-less constructor of the Type:</p>

<pre><code>public static object GetNewObject(Type t)
{
    try
    {
        return t.GetConstructor(new Type[] { }).Invoke(new object[] { });
    }
    catch
    {
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the same approach, contained in a generic method:</p>

<pre><code>public static T GetNewObject&lt;T&gt;()
{
    try
    {
        return (T)typeof(T).GetConstructor(new Type[] { }).Invoke(new object[] { });
    }
    catch
    {
        return default(T);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the language you are using has a supported method/function then just use that (as in the C# <code>ToTitleCase</code> method)</p>

<p>If it does not, then you will want to do something like the following:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Read in the string  </li>
<li>Take the first word  </li>
<li>Capitalize the first letter of that word <sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Go forward and find the next word  </li>
<li>Go to 3 if not at the end of the string, otherwise exit  </li>
</ol>

<p><sup>1</sup> To capitalize it in, say, C - use the <a href="http://www.asciitable.com" rel="nofollow">ascii codes</a> to find the integer value of the char and subtract 32 from it.</p>

<p>There would need to be much more error checking in the code (ensuring valid letters etc.), and the "Capitalize" function will need to impose some sort of "title-case scheme" on the letters to check for words that do not need to be capatilised ('and', 'but' etc. <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=349913" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a good scheme)</p>

<p>The <code>Activator</code> class within the root <code>System</code> namespace is pretty powerful.</p>

<p>There are a lot of overloads for passing parameters to the constructor and such. Check out the documentation at: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.activator.createinstance.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.activator.createinstance.aspx</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some simple examples:</p>

<pre><code>ObjectType instance = (ObjectType)Activator.CreateInstance(objectType);

ObjectType instance = (ObjectType)Activator.CreateInstance("MyAssembly","MyNamespace.ObjectType");
</code></pre>

<P>No, there are many applications built with VS2005 that have to support Windows XP, 2000, NT, the whole stack. The issue is that (by default) VS2005 wants to use libraries/exports not present on NT.</P>

<p>I can get Python to work with Postgresql but I cannot get it to work with MySQL. The main problem is that on the shared hosting account I have I do not have the ability to install things such as Django or PySQL, I generally fail when installing them on my computer so maybe it's good I can't install on the host.</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://barryp.org/software/bpgsql/">bpgsql</a> really good because it does not require an install, it's a single file that I can look at, read and then call the functions of. Does anybody know of something like this for MySQL?</p>
<p>You can print from the command line using the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>rundll32.exe
  %WINDIR%\System32\mshtml.dll,PrintHTML
  "%1"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where %1 is the file path of the html file to be printed.</p>

<p>If you don't need to print from memory (or can afford to write to the disk in a temp file) you can use:</p>

<pre><code>using (Process printProcess = new Process())<br>{<br>    string systemPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.System);<br>    printProcess.StartInfo.FileName = systemPath + @"\rundll32.exe";<br>    printProcess.StartInfo.Arguments = systemPath + @"\mshtml.dll,PrintHTML """ + fileToPrint + @"""";<br>    printProcess.Start();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>I haven't been able to find an understandable explanation of how to actually use Python's <code>itertools.groupby()</code> function.  What I'm trying to do is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a list - in this case, the children of an objectified <code>lxml</code> element</li>
<li>Divide it into groups based on some criteria</li>
<li>Then later iterate over each of these groups separately.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've reviewed <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html">the documentation</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby">the examples</a>, but I've had trouble trying to apply them beyond a simple list of numbers. </p>

<p>So, how do I use of <code>itertools.groupby()</code>?  Is there another technique I should be using?  Pointers to good "prerequisite" reading would also be appreciated.</p>

<p>I would be wary of automatically upcasing all whitespace-preceded-words in scenarios where I would run the risk of attracting the fury of nitpickers.</p>

<p>I would at least consider implementing a dictionary for exception cases like articles and conjunctions. Behold: </p>

LEFT JOIN history h 
   ON u.id=h.id 
   AND h.dateCol&lt;GETDATE()-1
GROUP BY u.Id, u.name

<p>A solution, albeit one that defers handling of the null value to the code, could be:</p>

<p>How can I detect which one of the defined fonts was used in the user's browser?</p>

<p><strong>Edit for people wondering why I want to do this:</strong> The font I'm detecting contains glyph's that are not available in other fonts and when the user does not have the font I want to display a link asking the user to download that font so they can use my web application with the correct font.</p>

<p>Currently I am displaying the download font link for all users, I want to only display this for people who do not have the correct font installed.</p>

<p>I've seen it done in a kind of iffy, but pretty reliable way.  Basically, an element is set to use a specific font and a string is set to that element.  If the font set for the element does not exist, it takes the font of the parent element.  So, what they do is measure the width of the rendered string.  If it matches what they expected for the desired font as opposed to the derived font, it's present.</p>

<p>Attempting to insert an escape character into a table results in a warning. </p>

<pre><code>create table EscapeTest (text varchar(50));

insert into EscapeTest (text) values ('This is the first part \n And this is the second');
</code></pre>

<p>Produces the warning:</p>

<pre><code>WARNING:  nonstandard use of escape in a string literal

<p>(<em>Using PSQL 8.2</em>)</p>

<p>Anyone know how to get around this?</p>

<p>Does doubling the \ work?</p>

<pre><code>insert into EscapeTest (text) values ('This will be inserted \\n This will not be');<br></code></pre>
<p>Partially. The text is inserted, but the warning is still generated.</p>

<p>I found a discussion that indicated the text needed to be preceded with 'E', as such:</p>

<pre><code>insert into EscapeTest (text) values (E'This is the first part \n And this is the second');
</code></pre>

<p>This suppressed the warning, but the text was still not being returned correctly. When I added the additional slash as Michael suggested, it worked.</p>

<p>As such:</p>

<pre><code>insert into EscapeTest (text) values (E'This is the first part \\n And this is the second');

<p>I'm maintaining a <code>.NET 1.1</code> application, and one of the things I've been tasked with is making sure the user doesn't see any unfriendly error notifications.</p>

<p>I've added handlers to <code>Application.ThreadException</code> and <code>AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException</code>, which do get called. My problem is that the standard <code>CLR</code> error dialog is still displayed (before the exception handler is called).</p>

<p>Jeff talks about this problem on his blog <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000201.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000216.html">here</a>. But there's no solution. So what is the standard way in <code>.NET 1.1</code> to handle uncaught exceptions and display a friendly dialog box?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Jeff's response was marked as the correct answer, because the link he provided has the most complete information on how to do what's required.</p>

<p>I've read that it is possible to add a method to an existing object (e.g. not in the class definition) in <strong>Python</strong>, I think this is called <em>Monkey Patching</em> (or in some cases <em>Duck Punching</em>). I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/982">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p>Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong><code>self</code></strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named <code>self</code> (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong><code>class.patch(obj)</code></strong> instead of just <strong><code>class.patch()</code></strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>

<p>Oh, and Ryan, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monkey">that</a> isn't exactly what I was looking for (it isn't a builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.</p>

<p>I don't know Python syntax, but I know Ruby can do it, and it is rather trivial.  Let's say you want to add a method to Array that prints the length to standard out:</p>

<pre><code>class Array<br>  def print_length<br>    puts length<br>  end<br>end<br></code></pre>

<p>If you don't want to modify the whole class, you can just add the method to a single instance of the array, and no other arrays will have the method:</p>

<pre><code>array = [1, 2, 3]<br>def array.print_length<br>  puts length<br>end<br></code></pre>

<p>Just be aware of the issues involved in using this feature.  Jeff Atwood actually <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001151.html" rel="nofollow">wrote about it</a> not too long ago.</p>
<p>is this a console app or a winforms app? If it's a .NET 1.1 console app this is, sadly, by design -- it's confirmed by a MSFT dev in the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000216.html" rel="nofollow">second blog post you referenced</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BTW, on my 1.1 machine the example from MSDN does have the expected output; it's just that the second line doesn't show up until after you've attached a debugger (or not). In v2 we've flipped things around so that the UnhandledException event fires before the debugger attaches, which seems to be what most people expect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like .NET 2.0 does this better (thank goodness), but honestly, I never had time to go back and check.</p>
<p>It's a WinForms app. The exceptions that are caught by Application.ThreadException work fine, and I don't get the ugly .NET exception box (OK to terminate, cancel to debug? who came up with that??).</p>

<p>I was getting some exceptions that weren't being caught by that and ended up going to the AppDomain.UnhandledException event that were causing problems. I think I've caught most of those exceptions and I am displaying them in our nice error box now.</p>

<p>So I'll just have to hope there are not some other circumstances that would cause exceptions to not be caught by the Application.ThreadException handler.</p>
<p>I need to grab the base64-encoded representation of the ViewState. Obviously this would not be available until fairly late in the request lifecycle, which is OK.</p>

<p>For example, if the output of the page includes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" 
  id="__VIEWSTATE" value="/wEPDwUJODU0Njc5MD...==" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I need a way on the server side to get the value <code>"/wEPDwUJODU0Njc5MD...=="</code></p>

<p>To clarify, I need this value when the page is being rendered, not on PostBack. e.g. I need to know the ViewState value that is being <em>sent</em> to the client, not the ViewState I'm getting back from them.</p>

<p>What is the best way to display <code>Flash</code> content in a <strong>C#</strong> WinForms application? I would like to create a user control (similar to the current <code>PictureBox</code>) that will be able to display images and flash content.</p>

<p>It would be great to be able to load the flash content from a <strong>stream</strong> of sorts rather than a file on disk.</p>

<p>While I haven't used a flash object inside a windows form application myself, I do know that it's possible.
In Visual studio on your toolbox, choose to add a new component.
Then in the new window that appears choose the <strong>"COM Components"</strong> tab to get a list in which you can find the <strong>"Shockwave Flash Object"</strong></p>

<p>Once added to the toolbox, simply use the control as you would use any other "standard" control from visual studio.</p>

<p>three simple commands are available to interact with the control:</p>

<ul>
<li>AxShockwaveFlash1.Stop()</li>
<li>AxShockwaveFlash1.Movie = FilePath &amp;
"\FileName.swf"</li>
<li>AxShockwaveFlash1.Play()</li>
</ul>

<p>which, I think, are all self explanatory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be great to be able to load
  the flash content from a stream of
  sorts rather than a file on disk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just saw you are also looking for a means to load the content from a stream,
and because I'm not really sure that is possible with the shockwave flash object I will give you another option (two actually).</p>

<p>the first is the one I would advise you to use only when necessary, as it uses the full blown <strong>"webbrowser component"</strong> (also available as an extra toolbox item), which is like trying to shoot a fly with a bazooka.
of course it will work, as the control will act as <a href="http://visualbasic.about.com/library/courses/blecvbsbs2202.htm">a real browser window</a> (actually the internet explorer browser), but its not really meant to be used in the way you need it.</p>

<p>the second option is to use something I just discovered while looking for more information about playing flash content inside a windows form. <a href="http://www.f-in-box.com/dotnet/#feature_flv_playing">F-IN-BOX</a> is a commercial solution that will also play content from a given website URL. (The link provided will direct you to the .NET code you have to use).</p>
<p>I'm looking for a way to delete a file which is locked by another process using C#. I suspect the method must be able to find which process is locking the file (perhaps by tracking the handles, although I'm not sure how to do this in C#) then close that process before being able to complete the file delete using <code>File.Delete()</code>.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a robust, easy-to-use, regular expression evaluator for native C++, either platform-independent or Windows-specific.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can't use Boost or ACE regex libraries (unfortunately)</li>
<li>Can't use .NET Regex (or any managed code)</li>
</ul>

<p>The main requirement is that it should be standalone and open.</p>

<p>Killing other processes is not a healthy thing to do. If your scenario involves something like uninstallation, you could use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365240%28VS.85%29.aspx"><strong><code>MoveFileEx</code></strong> API function</a> to mark the file for deletion upon next reboot.</p>

<p>If it appears that you really need to delete a file in use by another process, I'd recommend re-considering the actual problem before considering any solutions.</p>

<p>Oh, one big hack I employed years ago, is that Windows won't let you <em>delete</em> files, but it does let you <em>move</em> them.</p>

<p>Pseudo-sort-of-code:</p>

<pre><code>mv %WINDIR%\System32\mfc42.dll %WINDIR\System32\mfc42.dll.old
Install new mfc42.dll
Tell user to save work and restart applications
</code></pre>

<p>When the applications restarted (note we didn't need to reboot the machine), they loaded the new <code>mfc42.dll</code>, and all was well. That, coupled with <code>PendingFileOperations</code> to delete the old one the next time the whole system restarted, worked pretty well.</p>

<P>The typical method is as follows. You've said you want to do this in C# so here goes...</P>
<OL>
<LI>If you don't know which process has the file locked, you'll need to examine each process's handle list, and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file. Doing this in C# will likely require P/Invoke or an intermediary C++/CLI to call the native APIs you'll need.</LI>
<LI>Once you've figured out which process(es) have the file locked, you'll need to safely inject a small native DLL into the process (you can also inject a managed DLL, but this is messier, as you then have to start or attach to the .NET runtime).</LI>
<LI>That bootstrap DLL then closes the handle using CloseHandle etc.</LI></OL>
<P>Essentially: the way to unlock a "locked" file is to inject a DLL into the offending process's address space and close it yourself. You can do this using native or managed code. No matter what, you're going to need a small amount of native code or at least P/Invoke into the same.</P>

<p>Shooting flys with bazookas may be fun, but an embeded web brower is not the path that I am looking for. :)</p>

<p><em>There was a link on Adobe's site that talked about "Embedding and Communicating with the Macromedia Flash Player in C# Windows Applications" but they seem to have removed it :(</em></p>

<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

<p>Now here's the rub:<br>
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A colleague just walked past and asked "Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?"</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Reproduce the problem. <code>Dr Watson</code> will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. </li>

<p>I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on.</p>

<p>No I'm not, and I'll spend a couple of hours tomorrow going through the workspace (58 projects in it) and checking they're all compiling and linking with the appropriate flags.
<hR>
Update: This took 30 seconds.  Select all projects in the <code>Settings</code> dialog, unselect until you find the project(s) that don't have the right settings (they all had the right settings).</p>

<p>You tried old builds, but is there a reason you can't keep going further back in the repository history and seeing exactly when the bug was introduced?</p>

<p>Otherwise, I would suggest adding simple logging of some kind to help track down the problem, though I am at a loss of what specifically you might want to log.</p>

<p>If you can find out what exactly CAN cause this problem, via google and documentation of the exceptions you are getting, maybe that will give further insight on what to look for in the code.</p>
<p>My first choice would be a dedicated heap tool such as <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/286470" rel="nofollow">pageheap.exe</a>.</p>

<p>Rewriting new and delete might be useful, but that doesn't catch the allocs committed by lower-level code. If this is what you want, better to Detour the <code>low-level alloc API</code>s using Microsoft Detours.</p>

<p>Also sanity checks such as: verify your run-time libraries match (release vs. debug, multi-threaded vs. single-threaded, dll vs. static lib), look for bad deletes (eg, delete where delete [] should have been used), make sure you're not mixing and matching your allocs.</p>

<p>Also try selectively turning off threads and see when/if the problem goes away.</p>

<p>What does the call stack etc look like at the time of the first exception?</p>

<p>Rex, I suspect a good place to start looking is solutions that <strong>compress the ViewState</strong> -- they're grabbing ViewState on the server before it's sent down to the client and gzipping it. That's exactly where you want to be.</p>

<p>See this <a href="http://aspguy.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/reducing-the-page-size-by-storing-viewstate-on-server/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> where the author describes a method for overriding the default behavior for generating the ViewState and instead shows how to save it on the server Session object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In ASP.NET 2.0, ViewState is saved by
  a descendant of PageStatePersister
  class. This class is an abstract class
  for saving and loading ViewsState and
  there are two implemented descendants
  of this class in .Net Framework, named
  HiddenFieldPageStatePersister and
  SessionPageStatePersister. By default
  HiddenFieldPageStatePersister is used
  to save/load ViewState information,
  but we can easily get the
  SessionPageStatePersister to work and
  save ViewState in Session object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I did not test his code, it seems to show exactly what you want: a way to gain access to ViewState code while still on the server, before postback. </p>
<p>Exceptions in C++ don't need to be caught (no compile time errors) by the calling function. So it's up to developer's judgment whether to catch it using try/catch (unlike in Java). </p></p>

<p><p>Is there a way one can ensure that the exceptions thrown are always caught using try/catch by the calling function?</p>

<p><strong>AppDomain.UnhandledException</strong> is an <strong>event</strong>, not a global exception handler. This means, by the time it is raised, your application is already on its way down the drain, and there is nothing you can do about it, except for doing cleanup and error logging.</p>

<p>What happened behind the scenes is this: The framework detected the exception, walked up the call stack to the very top, found no handlers that would recover from the error, so was unable to determine if it was safe to continue execution. So, it started the shutdown sequence, and fired up this event as a courtesy to you so you can pay your respects to your already-doomed process. This happens when an exception is left unhandled in the main thread.</p>

<p>There is no single-point solution to this kind of error. You need to put a real exception handler (a catch block) upstream of all places where this error occurs and forward it to (for example) a global handler method/class that will determine if it is safe to simply report and continue, based on exception type and/or content.</p>

<p>Edit: It is possible to disable (=hack) the error-reporting mechanism built into Windows so the mandatory "crash and burn" dialog does not get displayed when your app goes down. However, this becomes effective for <em>all</em> the applications in the system, not just your own.</p>
<p>The GNU C library regular expressions facility (regcomp(), regexec() and friends) is broken. Use libetre instead; the function signatures match the ones provided by glibc.

<p>One of the sites I maintain relies heavily on use of <code>ViewState</code> (it isn't my code). However, on certain pages where the <code>ViewState</code> is extra-bloated, Safari throws a <code>"Validation of viewstate MAC failed"</code> error.</p>

<p>This appears to only happen in Safari. Firefox, IE and Opera all load successfully in the same scenario.</p>

<p>I've been doing a little research into this and whilst I'm not entirely sure its the cause I believe it is because Safari is not returning the full result set (hence cropping it).</p>

<p>I have been in dicussion with another developer and found the following post on Channel 9 as well which recommends making use of the SQL State service to store the viewstate avoiding the postback issue and also page size.</p>

<p>Does this seem like the best solution?</p>
<p>My first port of call would be to go through the elements on the page and see which controls:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will still work when I switch ViewState off</li>
<li>Can be moved out of the page and into an AJAX call to be loaded when required</li>
</ol>

<p>Failing that, and here's the disclaimer - I've never used this solution on a web-facing site - but in the past where I've wanted to eliminate massive ViewStates in limited-audience applications I have stored the ViewState in the Session.</p>

<p>It has worked for me because the hit to memory isn't significant for the number of users, but if you're running a fairly popular site I wouldn't recommend this approach.  However, if the Session solution works for Safari you could always detect the user agent and fudge appropriately.</p>
<p>Jeff, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11/how-do-i-calculate-relative-time/12#12">your code</a> is nice but could be clearer with constants (as suggested in Code Complete).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I'll just post here since some of the other posts are slightly inaccurate in relation to C#.</p>

<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <code>int</code> is an alias for <code>System.Int32</code>.<br/>
<strong>Wrong:</strong> <code>float</code> is not an alias for <code>System.Float</code>, but for <code>System.Single</code></p>

<p>Basically, int is a reserved keyword in the C# programming language, and is an alias for the <code>System.Int32</code> value type.</p>

<p>float and Float is not the same however, as the right system type for ''<code>float</code>'' is System.Single. There are some types like this that has reserved keywords that doesn't seem to match the type names directly.</p>

<p>In C# there is no difference between ''<code>int</code>'' and ''<code>System.Int32</code>'', or any of the other pairs or keywords/system types, except for when defining enums. With enums you can specify the storage size to use and in this case you can only use the reserved keyword, and not the system runtime type name.</p>

<p>Wether the value in the int will be stored on the stack, in memory, or as a referenced heap object depends on the context and how you use it.</p>

<p>This declaration in a method:</p>

<pre><code>int i;
</code></pre>

<p>defines a variable <code>i</code> of type <code>System.Int32</code>, living in a register or on the stack, depending on optimizations. The same declaration in a type (struct or class) defines a member field. The same declaration in a method argument list defines a parameter, with the same storage options as for a local variable. (note that this paragraph is not valid if you start pulling iterator methods into the mix, these are different beasts altogether)</p>

<p>To get a heap object, you can use boxing:</p>

<pre><code>object o = i;
</code></pre>

<p>this will create a boxed copy of the contents of <code>i</code> on the heap. In IL you can access methods on the heap object directly, but in C# you need to cast it back to an int, which will create another copy. Thus, the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in C# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value. (Ugh, this paragraph doesn't read all that easily.)</p>

<p>Is there any way to check whether a file is locked without using a try/catch block?  </p>

<p>Right now, the only way I know of is to just open the file and catch any <code>System.IO.IOException</code>.</p>

<p>No, unfortunately, and if you think about it, that information would be worthless anyway since the file could become locked the very next second (read: short timespan).</p>

<p>Why specifically do you need to know if the file is locked anyway? Knowing that might give us some other way of giving you good advice.</p>

<p>If your code would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>if not locked then
    open and update file
</code></pre>

<p>Then between the two lines, another process could easily lock the file, giving you the same problem you were trying to avoid to begin with: exceptions.</p>

<p>Why not use LINQ:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; myDict = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();
myDict.Add("one", 1);
myDict.Add("four", 4);
myDict.Add("two", 2);
myDict.Add("three", 3);

var sortedDict = from entry in myDict orderby entry.Value ascending select entry;
</code></pre>

<p>This would also allow for great flexibility in that you can select the top 10, 20 10% etc. Or if you are using your word frequency index for <code>type-ahead</code>, you could also include <code>StartsWith</code> clause as well.</p>

<p>For some reason Jeff's code didn't seem simple enough. To me this seems simpler and easier to understand:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime today = DateTime.Today;
int age = today.Year - bday.Year;

if (bday &gt; today.AddYears(-age))
    age--;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this assumes you are looking for the western idea of age and not using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_age_reckoning">East Asian reckoning</a>.</p>

<p>I would look into IMAP</p>

<p><a href="http://us3.php.net/imap" rel="nofollow">IMAP, POP3 and NNTP</a></p>

<p>Outside the scope of your question so I debated not posting this but in Java there are actually 2 types of exceptions, checked and unchecked. The basic difference is that, much like in <code>c[++]</code>, you dont have to catch an unchecked exception.</p>

<p>How do you express an integer as a binary number with Python literals?</p>

<p>I was easily able to find the answer for hex:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 0x12AF
    4783
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 0x100
    256
</code></pre>

<p>and octal:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 01267
    695
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 0100
    64
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How do you use literals to express binary in Python?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Summary of Answers</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using <code>int('01010101111',2)</code> but not with a literal.</li>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: there is <em>no way</em> to express binary literals.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: <code>0b1100111</code> or <code>0B1100111</code>.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: will also allow <code>0o27</code> or <code>0O27</code> (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.</li>
<li>Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older <code>027</code> syntax for octals.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am pretty sure this is one of the things due to change in Python 3.0 with perhaps bin() to go with hex() and oct().</p>

<p>EDIT:
lbrandy's answer is correct in all cases.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print int('01010101111',2)
687
&gt;&gt;&gt; print int('11111111',2)
255

<p>Another way.</p>

<p>I'm looking for some way to effectively hide inherited members. I have a library of classes which inherit from common base classes.  Some of the more recent descendant classes inherit dependency properties which have become vestigial and can be a little confusing when using <em>IntelliSense</em> or using the classes in a visual designer.</p>

<p>These classes are all controls that are written to be compiled for either WPF or Silverlight 2.0.  I know about <code>ICustomTypeDescriptor</code> and <code>ICustomPropertyProvider</code>, but I'm pretty certain those can't be used in Silverlight.  </p>

<p>It's not as much a functional issue as a usability issue.  What should I do?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Some of the properties that I would really like to hide come from ancestors that are not my own and because of a specific tool I'm designing for, I can't do member hiding with the <code>new</code> operator.  (I know, it's ridiculous)</p>

<p>While you cannot prevent usage of those inherited members to my knowledge, you should be able to hide them from IntelliSense using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.editorbrowsableattribute.aspx">EditorBrowsableAttribute</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Using System.ComponentModel;

[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
private string MyHiddenString = "Muahahahahahahahaha";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Just saw this in the documentation comments, which makes it kinda useless for this purpose:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a prominent note that states that this attribute "does not suppress members from a class in the same assembly". That is true but not complete. Actually, the attribute does not suppress members from a class in the same solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you're best least hackish way is to consider composition as opposed to inheritance.</p>

<p>Or, you could create an interface that has the members you want, have your derived class implement that interface, and program against the interface.</p>
<p>I've never been completely happy with the way exception handling works, there's a lot exceptions and try/catch brings to the table (stack unwinding, etc.), but it seems to break a lot of the OO model in the process.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the problem:</p>

<p>Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p>

<p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));<br>bool success = false;<br>while (!success)<br>{<br>    try<br>    {<br>        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail<br>        success = true;<br>    }<br>    catch (IOException e)<br>    {<br>        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)<br>        {<br>            throw e;<br>        }<br>        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p>

<pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()<br>    {<br>        // some code block<br>    } );<br></code></pre>

<p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to hear how other people would solve this sort of problem.</p>
<p>One potential thing you can do is contain the object rather than extend from the other class.  This will give you the most flexibility in terms of exposing what you want to expose, but if you absolutely need the object to be of that type it is not the ideal solution (however you could expose the object from a getter).</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass : BaseClass<br>{<br>    // Your stuff here<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass<br>{<br>    private BaseClass baseClass;<br><br>    public void ExposeThisMethod()<br>    {<br>        baseClass.ExposeThisMethod();<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass<br>{<br>    private BaseClass baseClass;<br><br>    public BaseClass BaseClass<br>    {<br>        get<br>        {<br>            return baseClass;<br>        }<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>
<P>If you use Visual Studio you can use Visual C++ 2008 Feature Pack Release, this implements some of TR1, and includes regular expression parsing. <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&amp;displaylang=en">Get it</A></P>
<p>Just wondering, what do you feel your method leaves to be desired?  You could replace the anonymous delegate with a.. named? delegate, something like</p>

<pre><code>    public delegate void IoOperation(params string[] parameters);<br><br>    public void FileDeleteOperation(params string[] fileName)<br>    {<br>        File.Delete(fileName[0]);<br>    }<br><br>    public void FileCopyOperation(params string[] fileNames)<br>    {<br>        File.Copy(fileNames[0], fileNames[1]);<br>    }<br><br>    public void RetryFileIO(IoOperation operation, params string[] parameters)<br>    {<br>        RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));<br>        bool success = false;<br>        while (!success)<br>        {<br>            try<br>            {<br>                operation(parameters);<br>                success = true;<br>            }<br>            catch (IOException e)<br>            {<br>                if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)<br>                {<br>                    throw;<br>                }<br>                fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();<br>            }<br>        }<br>    }<br><br>    public void Foo()<br>    {<br>        this.RetryFileIO(FileDeleteOperation, "L:\file.to.delete" );<br>        this.RetryFileIO(FileCopyOperation, "L:\file.to.copy.source", "L:\file.to.copy.destination" );<br>    }<br></code></pre>
<p>Override them like Michael Suggests <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1528/#1533" rel="nofollow">above</a> and to prevent folks from using the overridden (sp?) methods, mark them as obsolete:</p>

<pre><code>[Obsolete("These are not supported in this class.", true)]<br>public override void dontcallmeanymore()<br>{<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>This has already been answered for Java, here's the C# answer:</p>

<p>"Integer" is not a valid type name in C# and "int" is just an alias for System.Int32. Also, unlike in Java (or C++) there aren't any special primitive types in C#, every instance of a type in C# (including int) is an object. Here's some demonstrative code:</p>

<pre><code>void DoStuff()<br>{<br>    System.Console.WriteLine( SomeMethod((int)5) );<br>    System.Console.WriteLine( GetTypeName&lt;int&gt;() );<br>}<br><br>string SomeMethod(object someParameter)<br>{<br>    return string.Format("Some text {0}", someParameter.ToString());<br>}<br><br>string GetTypeName&lt;T&gt;()<br>{<br>    return (typeof (T)).FullName;<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>I was just looking through some information about Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/">protocol buffers</a> data interchange format.  Has anyone played around with the code or even created a project around it?</p>

<p>I'm currently using XML in a Python project for structured content created by hand in a text editor, and I was wondering what the general opinion was on Protocol Buffers as a user-facing input format.  The speed and brevity benefits definitely seem to be there, but there are so many factors when it comes to actually generating and processing the data.</p>
<p>I thought I'd give this a shot using classes and polymorphism. I had a previous iteration which used sub-classing which ended up having way too much overhead. I've switched to a more flexible delegate / public property object model which is significantly better. My code is very slightly more accurate, I wish I could come up with a better way to generate "months ago" that didn't seem too over-engineered.</p>

<p>Getting back into a bit more .NET after a few-years of not using it full-time, and wondering what the good unit testing packages are these days.</p>

<p>I'm familiar with NUnit (a few years ago), and have played briefly around with IronRuby, with the goal of getting something like rspec going, but don't know much beyond that.</p>

<p>I realize I could google for this and call it a day but I believe I'm likely to get a better and more informed response from asking a question here :-)</p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.mbunit.com/" rel="nofollow">MbUnit</a>, er, <a href="http://www.gallio.org/" rel="nofollow">Gallio</a>.  Most importantly to me is having good tools support inside Visual Studio.  For that I use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html" rel="nofollow">Resharper</a>, which has an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mbunit-resharper/" rel="nofollow">MbUnit test runner</a>.  A lot of folks seem to like <a href="http://www.testdriven.net/overview.aspx" rel="nofollow">TestDriven.NET</a> as their test runner as well.</p>
<P>If you are looking for user facing interaction, stick with xml. It has more support, understanding, and general acceptance currently. If it's internal, I would say that protocol buffers are a great idea.</P>
<P>Maybe in a few years as more tools come out to support protocol buffers, then start looking towards that for a public facing api. Until then... <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</A>?</P>
<p>There are so many it's crazy.  Crazy good, I guess.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the conservative types (me), <a href="http://www.nunit.org/"><strong>NUnit</strong></a> is still available and still more than capable.</li>
<li>For the Microsoft-types, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx"><strong>MSTest</strong></a> is adequate, but slow and clunky compared to Nunit.  It also lacks code coverage without paying the big bucks for the pricey versions of Visual Studio.</li>
<li>There's also <a href="http://www.mbunit.com/About.aspx"><strong>MbUnit</strong></a>.  It's like NUnit, but has nifty features like RowTest (run the same test with different parameters) and Rollback (put the database back like you found it after a test) </li>
<li>And finally, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xunit"><strong>xUnit.net</strong></a> is the trendy option with some attitude.</li>
<li>Oh, and <a href="http://testdriven.net/"><strong>TestDriven.NET</strong></a> will give you IDE integration for both Nunit and MBunit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure they're all just fine.  I'd steer away from MSTest though, unless you just enjoy the convenience of having everything in one IDE out of the box.</p>

<p>I've got a menu in Python. That part was easy. I'm using <code>raw_input()</code> to get the selection from the user. </p>

<p>The problem is that <code>raw_input</code> (and input) require the user to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after they make a selection. Is there any way to make the program act immediately upon a keystroke? Here's what I've got so far:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
print """Menu
1) Say Foo
2) Say Bar"""
answer = raw_input("Make a selection&gt; ")

if "1" in answer: print "foo"
elif "2" in answer: print "bar"

<p>It would be great to have something like</p>

<pre><code>print menu
while lastKey = "":
    lastKey = check_for_recent_keystrokes()
if "1" in lastKey: #do stuff...

<p>I am currently working on a project and my goal is to locate text in an image. OCR'ing the text is not my intention as of yet. I want to basically obtain the bounds of text within an image. I am using the AForge.Net imaging component for manipulation. Any assistance in some sense or another?</p>

<p>Update 2/5/09:
I've since went along another route in my project. However I did attempt to obtain text using MODI (Microsoft Office Document Imaging). It allows you to OCR an image and pull text from it with some ease.</p>

<p>How do I delimit a Javascript databound string parameter in an anchor <code>OnClick</code> event?</p>

<ul>
<li>I have an anchor tag in an ASP.NET Repeater control.  </li>
<li>The <code>OnClick</code> event of the anchor contains a call to a Javascript function.  </li>
<li>The Javascript function takes a string for its input parameter.  </li>
<li>The string parameter is populated with a databound value from the Repeater.</li>
</ul>

<p>I need the "double quotes" for the <code>Container.DataItem</code>.<br>
I need the 'single quotes' for the <code>OnClick</code>.</p>

<p>And I still need <em>one more delimiter</em> (triple quotes?) for the input string parameter of the Javascript function call.</p>

<p>Since I can't use 'single quotes' again, how do I ensure the Javascript function knows the input parameter is a string and not an integer?</p>

<p>Without the extra quotes around the input string parameter, the Javascript function thinks I'm passing in an integer.</p>

<p>Cheers in advance for any knowledge you can drop.</p>

<p>The anchor:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id="aShowHide" onclick='ToggleDisplay(&lt;%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "JobCode") %&gt;);' &gt;Show/Hide&lt;/a&gt;    
</code></pre>

<p>and here is the Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"&gt;
/* Shows/Hides the Jobs Div */
  function ToggleDisplay(jobCode)
  {
  /* Each div has it's ID set dynamically ('d' plus the JobCode) */
    var elem = document.getElementById('d' + jobCode);

    if (elem) 
    {
      if (elem.style.display != 'block') 
      {
        elem.style.display = 'block';
        elem.style.visibility = 'visible';
      } 
      else
      {
        elem.style.display = 'none';
        elem.style.visibility = 'hidden';
      }
    }
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>Edit: I'm pretty sure you could just use double quotes outside the script block as well.</p>
<p>The  reason msvcrt fails in IDLE is because IDLE is not accessing the library that runs msvcrt. Whereas when you run the program natively in cmd.exe it works nicely. For the same reason that your program blows up on Mac and Linux terminals.</p>

<p>Try</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id="aShowHide" onclick='ToggleDisplay(&amp;#34;&lt;%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "JobCode") %&gt;&amp;#34;);'&gt;Show/Hide&lt;/a&gt;

<p>Using ASP.NET MVC there are situations (such as form submission) that may require a <code>RedirectToAction</code>.  </p>

<p>One such situation is when you encounter validation errors after a form submission and need to redirect back to the form, but would like the URL to reflect the URL of the form, not the action page it submits to.</p>

<p>As I require the form to contain the originally <code>POST</code>ed data, for user convenience, as well as validation purposes, how can I pass the data through the <code>RedirectToAction()</code>?  If I use the viewData parameter, my <code>POST</code> parameters will be changed to <code>GET</code> parameters.</p>

<p>The solution is to use the TempData property to store the desired Request components.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Send()
{
    TempData["form"] = Request.Form;
    return this.RedirectToAction(a =&gt; a.Form());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your "Form" action you can go:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Form()
{
    /* Declare viewData etc. */

    if (TempData["form"] != null)
    {
        /* Cast TempData["form"] to 
        System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollection 
        and use it */
    }

    return View("Form", viewData);
}

<p>I was just wondering if there is an elegant way to set the maximum CPU load for a particular thread doing intensive calculations. 
<br/><br/>Right now I have located the most time consuming loop in the thread (it does only compression) and use <code>GetTickCount()</code> and <code>Sleep()</code> with hardcoded values. It makes sure that the loop continues for a certain period of time and than sleeps for a certain minimal time. It more or less does the job i.e. guarantees that the thread will not use more than 50% of CPU. <br>However behavior is dependent on the number of CPU cores (huge disadvantage) and simply ugly (smaller disadvantage :)). <br>Any ideas?</p>

<p>In many places, <code>(1,2,3)</code> and <code>[1,2,3]</code> can be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>When should I use one or the other, and why?</p>

<p>I can't think of any cross platform way of what you want (or any guaranteed way full stop) but as you are using GetTickCount perhaps you aren't interested in cross platform :)</p>

<p>I'd use interprocess communications and set the intensive processes nice levels to get what you require but I'm not sure that's appropriate for your situation.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I agree with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1982/#1984" rel="nofollow">Bernard</a> which is why I think a process rather than a thread might be more appropriate but it just might not suit your purposes.</p>
<p>The list [1,2,3] is dynamic and flexible but that flexibility comes at a speed cost.</p>

<p>The tuple (1,2,3) is fixed (immutable) and therefore faster.</p>

<p>I have values stored as strings in a <code>DataTable</code> where each value could really represent an <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, or <code>string</code> (they were all converted to strings during an import process from an external data source). I need to test and see what type each value really is.</p>

<p>What is more efficient for the application (or is there no practical difference)?</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to convert to <code>int</code> (and then <code>double</code>). If conversion works, the return <code>true</code>. If an exception is thrown, return <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Regular expressions designed to match the pattern of an <code>int</code> or <code>double</code></li>
<li>Some other method?</li>
</ol>

<p>Would use double.TryParse, it has performance benefits.</p>

<p>I'd personally use int.tryparse, then double.tryparse.  Performance on those methods is quite fast.  They both return a Boolean.  If both fail then you have a string, per how you defined your data. </p>
<p>On linux, you can change the scheduling priority of a thread with nice().</p>
<p>I would say, don't worry so much about such micro performance.  It is much better to just get something to work, and then make it as clear and concise and easy to read as possible.  The worst thing you can do is sacrifice readability for an insignificant amount of performance.</p>

<p>In the end, the best way to deal with performance issues is to save them for when you have data that indicates there is an actual performance problem... otherwise you will spend a lot of time micro-optimizing and actually cause higher maintenance costs for later on.</p>

<p>If you find this parsing situation is really the bottleneck in your application, THEN is the time to try and figure out what the fastest way to solve the problem is.  I think Jeff (and many others) have blogged about this sort of thing a lot.</p>
<p>One way of deciding whether or not to use nested classes is to think whether or not this class plays a supporting role or it's own part.</p>

<p>If it exists solely for the purpose of helping another class then I generally make it a nested class. There are a whole load of caveats to that, some of which seem contradictory but it all comes down to experience and gut-feeling.</p>
<p>sounds like a case where you could use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern" rel="nofollow">strategy pattern</a></p>
<p>A windows exe file has access to the command string which invoked it, including its path and filename. eg. <code>C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe --help</code>.</p>

<p>Untested though, been some time since I worked with Delphi :)</p>

<p>Looking for books or other references that discuss actually <em>"how"</em> to write a code coverage tool in Java; some of the various techniques or tricks - source vs. byte code instrumentation. This is for a scripting language that generates java byte code under the hood.</p>

<p>The .Net 2.0 framework namespace <code>System.IO.Compression</code> supports GZip and Deflate algorithms. Here are two methods that compress and decompress a byte stream which you can get from your file object. You can subsitute <code>GZipStream</code> for <code>DefaultStream</code> in the methods below to use that algorithm. This still leaves the problem of handling files compressed with different algorithms though.</p>

<pre><code>public static byte[] Compress(byte[] data)
{
    MemoryStream output = new MemoryStream();

    GZipStream gzip = new GZipStream(output, CompressionMode.Compress, true);
    gzip.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
    gzip.Close();

    return output.ToArray();
}

public static byte[] Decompress(byte[] data)
{
    MemoryStream input = new MemoryStream();
    input.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
    input.Position = 0;

    GZipStream gzip = new GZipStream(input, CompressionMode.Decompress, true);

    MemoryStream output = new MemoryStream();

    byte[] buff = new byte[64];
    int read = -1;

    read = gzip.Read(buff, 0, buff.Length);

    while (read &gt; 0)
    {
        output.Write(buff, 0, read);
        read = gzip.Read(buff, 0, buff.Length);
    }

    gzip.Close();

<p>Is there anyway I can implement MVC without the use of VS?</p>

<p>Is there a way to create a <code>JButton</code> with your own button graphic and not just with an image inside the button? </p>

<p>If not, is there another way to create a custom button in java?</p>

<p>I haven't done SWING development since my early CS classes but if it wasn't built in you could just inherit javax.swing.AbstractButton and create your own. Should be pretty simple to wire something together with their existing framework.</p>
<p>You could always try the Synth look &amp; feel. You provide an xml file that acts as a sort of stylesheet, along with any images you want to use. The code might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    SynthLookAndFeel synth = new SynthLookAndFeel();
    Class aClass = MainFrame.class;
    InputStream stream = aClass.getResourceAsStream("\\default.xml");

    if (stream == null) {
        System.err.println("Missing configuration file");
        System.exit(-1);                
    }

    synth.load(stream, aClass);

    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(synth);
} catch (ParseException pe) {
    System.err.println("Bad configuration file");
    pe.printStackTrace();
    System.exit(-2);
} catch (UnsupportedLookAndFeelException ulfe) {
    System.err.println("Old JRE in use. Get a new one");
    System.exit(-3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>From there, go on and add your JButton like you normally would. The only change is that you use the setName(string) method to identify what the button should map to in the xml file.</p>

<p>The xml file might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;synth&gt;
    &lt;style id="button"&gt;
        &lt;font name="DIALOG" size="12" style="BOLD"/&gt;
        &lt;state value="MOUSE_OVER"&gt;
            &lt;imagePainter method="buttonBackground" path="dirt.png" sourceInsets="2 2 2 2"/&gt;
            &lt;insets top="2" botton="2" right="2" left="2"/&gt;
        &lt;/state&gt;
        &lt;state value="ENABLED"&gt;
            &lt;imagePainter method="buttonBackground" path="dirt.png" sourceInsets="2 2 2 2"/&gt;
            &lt;insets top="2" botton="2" right="2" left="2"/&gt;
        &lt;/state&gt;
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;bind style="button" type="name" key="dirt"/&gt;
&lt;/synth&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The bind element there specifies what to map to (in this example, it will apply that styling to any buttons whose name property has been set to "dirt").</p>

<p>I'm looking to add a testing suite to my application, however I can't move to the newer testing frameworks for .NET 3.5. </p>

<p>Does anyone have a suggestion about good testing frameworks to use?</p>

<P>Thxm, Mc! http://asm.objectweb.org/ is another one. <EM>Excellent</EM> documentation on byte code instrumentation, but nothing "directly" aimed at writing a coverage tool - just some hints or ideas.</P>
<p>Yes, this is possible. One of the main pros for using Swing is the ease with which the abstract controls can be created and manipulates.</p>

<p>Here is a quick and dirty way to extend the existing JButton class to draw a circle to the right of the text.</p>

<pre><code>package test;

import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.Container;
import java.awt.Dimension;
import java.awt.FlowLayout;
import java.awt.Graphics;

import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class MyButton extends JButton {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private Color circleColor = Color.BLACK;

    public MyButton(String label) {
        super(label);
    }

    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);

        Dimension originalSize = super.getPreferredSize();
        int gap = (int) (originalSize.height * 0.2);
        int x = originalSize.width + gap;
        int y = gap;
        int diameter = originalSize.height - (gap * 2);

        g.setColor(circleColor);
        g.fillOval(x, y, diameter, diameter);
    }

    @Override
    public Dimension getPreferredSize() {
        Dimension size = super.getPreferredSize();
        size.width += size.height;
        return size;
    }

    /*Test the button*/
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyButton button = new MyButton("Hello, World!");

        JFrame frame = new JFrame();
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setSize(400, 400);

        Container contentPane = frame.getContentPane();
        contentPane.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        contentPane.add(button);

        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that by overriding <strong>paintComponent</strong> that the contents of the button can be changed, but that the border is painted by the <strong>paintBorder</strong> method. The <strong>getPreferredSize</strong> method also needs to be managed in order to dynamically support changes to the content. Care needs to be taken when measuring font metrics and image dimensions.</p>

<p>For creating a control that you can rely on, the above code is not the correct approach. Dimensions and colours are dynamic in Swing and are dependent on the look and feel being used. Even the default <em>Metal</em> look has changed across JRE versions. It would be better to implement <strong>AbstractButton</strong> and conform to the guidelines set out by the Swing API. A good starting point is to look at the <strong>javax.swing.LookAndFeel</strong> and <strong>javax.swing.UIManager</strong> classes.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/LookAndFeel.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/LookAndFeel.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/UIManager.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/UIManager.html</a></p>

<p>Understanding the anatomy of LookAndFeel is useful for writing controls:

<p>For a Mock Object library, I've found the BSD-licensed <a href="http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx" rel="nofollow">Rhino.Mocks</a> to be rather pleasing.</p>
<p>When I was first learning Java we had to make Yahtzee and I thought it would be cool to create custom Swing components and containers instead of just drawing everything on one JPanel.  The benefit of extending Swing components, of course, is to have the ability to add support for keyboard shortcuts and other accessibility features that you can't do just by having a paint() method print a pretty picture.  It may not be done the best way however, but it may be a good starting point for you.</p>

<p>Edit 8/6 - If it wasn't apparent from the images, each Die is a button you can click. This will move it to the DiceContainer below.  Looking at the source code you can see that each Die button is drawn dynamically, based on its value.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pgyQp.jpg" alt="alt text"><br>
<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jkYRd.jpg" alt="alt text"><br>
<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9BI34.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>Here are the basic steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a class that extends JComponent</li>
<li>Call parent constructor super() in your constructors</li>
<li>Make sure you class implements MouseListener</li>
<li><p>Put this in the constructor:</p>

<pre><code>enableInputMethods(true);   
addMouseListener(this);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Override these methods:</p>

<pre><code>public Dimension getPreferredSize()  
public Dimension getMinimumSize()  
public Dimension getMaximumSize()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Override this method:</p>

<pre><code>public void paintComponent(Graphics g)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>The amount of space you have to work with when drawing your button is defined by getPreferredSize(), assuming getMinimumSize() and getMaximumSize() return the same value.  I haven't experimented too much with this but, depending on the layout you use for your GUI your button could look completely different.</p>

<p>And finally, the <a href="https://github.com/kdeloach/labs/blob/master/java/yahtzee/src/Dice.java">source code</a>.  In case I missed anything.  </p>

<p><strong>NUnit</strong> is available at <a href="http://www.nunit.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.nunit.org</a>
I would suggest this even when working on the MS stack - the support for non-MS frameworks is happening in the MVC previews which shows a definite movement in the right direction to allow us all to customise our stacks to fit.</p>

<p>I currently use a DataTable to get results from a database which I can use in my code.</p>

<p>However, many example on the web show using a DataSet instead and accessing the table(s) through the collections method.</p>

<p>Is there any advantage, performance wise or otherwise, of using DataSets or DataTables as a storage method for SQL results?</p>

<p>in 1.x there used to be things DataTables couldn't do which DataSets could (don't remember exactly what). All that was changed in 2.x.  My guess is that's why a lot of examples still use DataSets.  DataTables should be quicker as they are more lightweight. If you're only pulling a single resultset, its your best choice between the two.</p>
<p>Is there a way of mapping data collected on a stream or array to a data structure or vice-versa?
In C++ this would simply be a matter of casting a pointer to the stream as a data type I want to use (or vice-versa for the reverse)
eg: in C++</p>

<pre><code>Mystruct * pMyStrct = (Mystruct*)&amp;SomeDataStream;
pMyStrct-&gt;Item1 = 25;

int iReadData = pMyStrct-&gt;Item2;
</code></pre>

<p>obviously the C++ way is pretty unsafe unless you are sure of the quality of the stream data when reading incoming data, but for outgoing data is super quick and easy.</p>

<p>It really depends on the sort of data you're bringing back.  Since a DataSet is (in effect) just a collection of DataTable objects, you can return multiple distinct sets of data into a single, and therefore more manageable, object.  </p>

<p>Performance-wise, you're more likely to get inefficiency from unoptimized queries than from the "wrong" choice of .NET construct.  At least, that's been my experience.</p>

<p>I am building a web page to show a customer what software they purchased and to give them a link to download said software.  Unfortunately, the data on what was purchased and the download information are in separate databases so I can't just take care of it with joins in a query.</p>

<p>The common item is SKU.  I'll be pulling back a list of SKUs from the customer purchases database, and on the download table is a comma delineated list of SKUs associated with that download.  My intention, at the moment, is to create from this one datatable to populate a GridView.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to do this efficiently would be appreciated.  If it helps, I can pretty easily pull back the data as a DataSet or a DataReader, if either one would be better for this purpose.</p>

<p>I am thinking off the top of my head here. If you load both as Data Tables in the same Data Sets, and define a relation between the two over SKU, and then run a query on the Data Set which produces the desired result.</p>
<P>if its .net on both sides:</P>
<P>think you should use binary serialization and send the byte[] result.</P>
<P>trusting your struct to be fully blittable can be trouble.</P>
<P>you will pay in some overhead (both cpu and network) but will be safe.</P>
<p>I have created a PHP-script to update a webserver that is live inside a local directory.
I'm migrating the script into Python. It works fine for the most part, but after a PUT command the size of the file appears to change. Thus, the size of the file is different from that of the file on the server. </p>

<p>Once I download again the file from the FTP server, the only difference is the CR/LF mark. This annoys me because the same script is comparing the size of the files to update. Also, in case it means anything, the script works perfectly in PHP va ftp_put.</p>

<pre><code>from ftplib import FTP

ftpserver = "myserver"
ftpuser = "myuser"
ftppass = "mypwd"

locfile =  "g:/test/style.css"
ftpfile =  "/temp/style.css"

try:
    ftp = FTP(ftpserver, ftpuser, ftppass)
except:
    exit ("Cannot connect")

f = open (locfile, "r")
try:
    ftp.delete (ftpfile)
except:
    pass

# ftp.sendcmd ("TYPE I")
# ftp.storlines("STOR %s" % ftpfile, f)
ftp.storbinary("STOR %s" % ftpfile, f)
f.close()

ftp.dir (ftpfile)
ftp.quit()
</code></pre>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Do you need to open the locfile in binary using <code>rb</code>?</p>

<pre><code>f = open (locfile, "rb")
</code></pre>

<p>Well if you go under the properties of your file in Windows or a *nix environment, you will notice two sizes.  One is the sector size, and one is the actual size.  The sector size is the number of sectors in bytes that are used up on your hard disk.  That is because two files cannot be in the same sector with most modern file systems, so if your file fills up half of the sector the whole sector is marked as filled.</p>

<p>So you might be comparing the sector file size to the actual file size on the FTP server or vice versa.</p>
<p>As long as the two databases are on the same physical server (assuming MSSQL) and the username/password being used in the connection string has rights to both DBs, then you should be able to perform a join across the two databases. Example: </p>

<pre><code>select p.Date,<br>       p.Amount,<br>       d.SoftwareName,<br>       d.DownloadLink<br>from   PurchaseDB.dbo.Purchases as p<br>join   ProductDB.dbo.Products as d on d.sku = p.sku<br>where  p.UserID = 12345 <br></code></pre>

Marshal.StructureToPtr(o, handle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), false);
handle.Free();
</code></pre>

<pre><code>handle = GCHandle.Alloc(buffer, GCHandleType.Pinned);
o = (YourStruct)Marshal.PtrToStructure(handle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), typeof(YourStruct));
handle.Free();
</code></pre>

<p>They'll throw different exceptions. <br>
() : NullReferenceException <br>
as : InvalidCastException <br>
Which could help for debugging.</p>

<p>The "as" keyword attempts to cast the object and if the cast fails, null is returned silently. The () cast operator will throw an exception immediately if the cast fails.</p>

<p>"Only use the C# "as" keyword where you are expecting the cast to fail in a non-exceptional case. If you are counting on a cast to succeed and are unprepared to receive any object that would fail, you should use the () cast operator so that an appropriate and helpful exception is thrown."</p>

<p>Here is a UDF which will do it.  It will return a table of the delimited values, haven't tried all scenarios on it but your example works fine.</p>

<p>Let's say that we have an ARGB color:</p>

<pre><code>Color argb = Color.FromARGB(127, 69, 12, 255); //Light Urple.
</code></pre>

<p>When this is painted on top of an existing color, the colors will blend. So when it is blended with white, the resulting color is <code>Color.FromARGB(255, 162, 133, 255);</code></p>

<p>The solution should work like this:</p>

<pre><code>Color blend = Color.White; 
Color argb = Color.FromARGB(127, 69, 12, 255); //Light Urple.      
Color rgb = ToRGB(argb, blend); //Same as Color.FromARGB(255, 162, 133, 255);
</code></pre>

<p>What is <code>ToRGB</code>'s implementation?      </p>

<p>It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha blending</a>.</p>

<p>In psuedocode, assuming the background color (blend) always has 255 alpha. Also assumes alpha is 0-255.</p>

<pre><code>alpha=argb.alpha()<br>r = (alpha/255)*argb.r() + (1 - alpha/255)*blend.r()<br>g = (alpha/255)*argb.g() + (1 - alpha/255)*blend.g()<br>b = (alpha/255)*argb.b() + (1 - alpha/255)*blend.b()<br></code></pre>

<p><em>note: you probably need to be a bit (more) careful about floating-point/int math and rounding issues, depending on language. Cast intermediates accordingly</em></p>

<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong></p>

<p>If you don't have a background color with an alpha of 255, the algebra gets alot more complicated. I've done it before and it's a fun exercise left to the reader (if you really need to know, ask another question :). </p>

<p>In other words, what color C blends into some background the same as blending A, then blending B. This is sort of like calculating A+B (which isn't the same as B+A).</p>
<p>I've always been intrigued by Map Routing, but I've never found any good introductory (or even advanced!) level tutorials on it. Does anybody have any pointers, hints, etc?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm primarily looking for pointers as to how a map system is implemented (data structures, algorithms, etc).</p>

<p>I have an application that displays an image inside of a Windows Forms <code>PictureBox</code> control.  The <code>SizeMode</code> of the control is set to <code>Zoom</code> so that the image contained in the <code>PictureBox</code> will be displayed in an aspect-correct way regardless of the dimensions of the <code>PictureBox</code>.</p>

<p>This is great for the visual appearance of the application because you can size the window however you want and the image will always be displayed using its best fit.  Unfortunately, I also need to handle mouse click events on the picture box and need to be able to translate from screen-space coordinates to image-space coordinates.</p>

<p>It looks like it's easy to translate from screen space to control space, but I don't see any obvious way to translate from control space to image space (i.e. the pixel coordinate in the source image that has been scaled in the picture box).</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to do this, or should I just duplicate the scaling math that they're using internally to position the image and do the translation myself?</p>

<p>Depending on the scaling, the relative image pixel could be anywhere in a number of pixels.  For example, if the image is scaled down significantly, pixel 2, 10 could represent 2, 10 all the way up to 20, 100), so you'll have to do the math yourself and take full responsibility for any inaccuracies!  :-)</p>
<p>xUnit.net looks like it provides a slightly different approach to N/MB/MS/Unit, which is interesting.</p>

<p>In my search for an rspec-like solution (because I LOVE the rspec), I also came across <a href="http://nspec.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow">NSpec</a>, which looks a bit wordy, but combined with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nspec-extensions/" rel="nofollow">NSpec Extensions</a> addon to use C#3 extension methods, it looks pretty nice.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of trying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Soup">Beautiful Soup</a>, a Python package for HTML scraping. Are there any other HTML scraping packages I should be looking at? Python is not a requirement, I'm actually interested in hearing about other languages as well.</p>

<p>I would first find out if the site(s) in question provide an API server or RSS Feeds for access the data you require.</p>
<p>The Ruby world's equivalent to Beautiful Soup is why_the_lucky_stiff's <a href="https://github.com/hpricot/hpricot">Hpricot</a>.</p>

<p><strong>My Goal</strong></p>

<p>I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common <code>IComponent</code> interface with a single method <code>DoStuff()</code>.</p>

<p>Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of <code>IComponent</code>. The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component.</p>

<p>The lifetime of the complete system looks like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Application starts.</li>
<li>Check configuration file for components to load. Load them.</li>
<li><strong>For each component, run <code>DoStuff()</code> to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads.</strong></li>
<li>Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code>. It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4.</p>

<p>It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>When a component tries to fire up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code> (the exact line of code is when the component runs <code>Application.Run(theForm)</code>), the component and hence our system "hangs" at the <code>Application.Run()</code> line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.</p>

<p>Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComponent1: IComponent
{
    public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database  }
}

public class MyComponent2: IComponent
{
    public void DoStuff()
    {
        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new Form());

        // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI 
        // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed.</p>

<pre><code>public void DoStuff()
{
    new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start()
}

private void ThreadedInitialize()
{
    Application.EnableVisualStyles();
    Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
    Application.Run(new Form());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to spin off a GUI and return after <code>Application.Run()</code>?</p>

<p>Regular expressions work pretty well for HTML scraping as well ;-)  Though after looking at Beautiful Soup, I can see why this would be a valuable tool.</p>
<p><strong>Application.Run</strong> method displays one (or more) forms and initiates the standard message loop which runs until all the forms are closed. You cannot force a return from that method except by closing all your forms or forcing an application shutdown.</p>

<p>You can, however, pass an <strong>ApplicationContext</strong> (instad of a new Form()) to Application.Run method and ApplicationContext can be used to launch several forms at once. Your application will only end when all of those are closed. See here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.application.run.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.application.run.aspx</a></p>

<p>Also, any forms that you Show non-modally will continue to run alongside your main form, which will enable you to have more than one windows that do not block each other. I believe this is actually what you are trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>I have been working with <em>JXTA</em> 2.3 for the last year or so for a peer-to-peer computing platform I am developing. I am migrating to <em>JXTA</em> 2.5 and in the process I am trying to clean up a lot of my use of <em>JXTA</em>. For the most part, I approached <em>JXTA</em> with a <strong>just make it work</strong> attitude. I used it to jumpstart creating and managing my peer-to-peer overlay network and providing basic communication services. I would like to use it in a more <em>JXTA</em> way since I am making changes to move to 2.5 anyway.</p>

<p>My first step would be a basic creation of a custom <code>PeerGroup</code>. I see some new new mechanisms that are using the <code>META-INF.services</code> infrastructure of Java. Should I be listing a related <code>PeerGroup</code> implementing object here with a <em>GUID</em> in <code>net.jxta.platform.Module</code>? As I understand it, if I do this, when a group with a spec ID matching the <em>GUID</em> is encountered and joined or created it should automatically use the matching object. I should be able to just manually tie a <code>PeerGroup</code> object to the group but this new method using <code>META-INF</code> seems to be a lot easier to manage.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any pointers or examples of using this infrastructure for <code>PeerGroup</code> implementation? Also, some general information on the <code>META-INF.services</code> mechanism in Java would be helpful.</p>

<p>Python works on multiple platforms and can be used for desktop and web applications, thus I conclude that there is some way to compile it into an executable for Mac, Windows and Linux.</p>

<p>The problem being I have no idea where to start or how to write a GUI with it, can anybody shed some light on this and point me in the right direction please?</p>
<p>First you will need some GUI library with Python bindings and then (if you want) some program that will convert your python scripts into standalone executables.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-platform GUI libraries with Python bindings (Windows, Linux, Mac)</strong></p>

<p>Of course, there are many, but the most popular that I've seen in wild are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter">Tkinter</a>  - based on <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tk GUI toolkit</a> (de-facto standard GUI library for python, free for commercial projects)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">WxPython</a> - based on <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">WxWidgets</a> (very popular, free for commercial projects)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/news">PyQt</a> - based on <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/">Qt</a> (also very popular and more stable than WxWidgets but costly license for commercial projects)</li>
</ul>

<p>Complete list is at <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming">http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming</a></p>

<p><strong>Single executable (Windows)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.py2exe.org/">py2exe</a> - Probably the most popular out there (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2933/an-executable-python-app/31859#31859">PyInstaller</a> is also gaining in popularity)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Single executable (Linux)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Freeze">Freeze</a> - works the same way like py2exe but targets Linux platform</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Single executable (Mac)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pythonhosted.org/py2app/">py2app</a> - again, works like py2exe but targets Mac OS</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure this is possible if you hack at it hard enough, but I'd suggest it is not a good idea.</p>

<p>'Windows' (that you see on the screen) are highly coupled to processes. That is, each process which displays any GUI is expected to have a Message Loop, which processes all of the messages which are involved with creating and managing windows (things like 'clicked the button', 'closed the app', 'redraw the screen' and so on.</p>

<p>Because of this, it is more or less assumed that if you have any message loop, it must be available for the lifetime of your process. For example windows might send you a 'quit' message, and you need to have a message loop available to handle that, even if you've got nothing on the screen.</p>

<p>Your best bet is do it like this:</p>

<p>Make a fake form which is never shown which is your 'main app'
Start up
Call Application.Run and pass in this fake form.
Do your work in another thread, and fire events at the main thread when you need to do Gui stuff.</p>
<p>For Perl, there's WWW::Mechanize.</p>
<p>For parsing player commands, I've most often used the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split%28java.lang.String%29">split</a> method to split a string by delimiters and then to then just figure out the rest by a series of <code>if</code>s or <code>switch</code>es. What are some different ways of parsing strings in Java?</p>

<p>I really like regular expressions. As long as the command strings are fairly simple, you can write a few regexes that could take a few pages of code to manually parse.</p>

<p>I would suggest you check out <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info">http://www.regular-expressions.info</a> for a good intro to regexes, as well as specific examples for Java.</p>

<p>Since python is installed on nearly every non-Windows OS by default now, the only thing you really need to make sure of is that all of the non-standard libraries you use are installed.</p>

<p>Having said that, it is possible to build executables that include the python interpreter, and any libraries you use.  This is likely to create a large executable, however.</p>

<p>MacOS X even includes support in the Xcode IDE for creating full standalone GUI apps.  These can be run by any user running OS X.</p>
<p>In Python, there is a difference between functions and bound methods.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...     print "foo"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
...     def bar( self ):
...         print "bar"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
&lt;function foo at 0x00A98D70&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.bar
&lt;bound method A.bar of &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x00A9BC88&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Bound methods have been "bound" (how descriptive) to an instance, and that instance will be passed as the first argument whenever the method is called.</p>

<p>Callables that are attributes of a class (as opposed to an instance) are still unbound, though, so you can modify the class definition whenever you want:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def fooFighters( self ):
...     print "fooFighters"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; A.fooFighters = fooFighters
&gt;&gt;&gt; a2 = A()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a2.fooFighters
&lt;bound method A.fooFighters of &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x00A9BEB8&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a2.fooFighters()
fooFighters
</code></pre>

<p>Previously defined instances are updated as well (as long as they haven't overridden the attribute themselves):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.fooFighters()
fooFighters
</code></pre>

<p>The problem comes when you want to attach a method to a single instance:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def barFighters( self ):
...     print "barFighters"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters = barFighters
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: barFighters() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
</code></pre>

<p>The function is not automatically bound when it's attached directly to an instance:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters
&lt;function barFighters at 0x00A98EF0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To bind it, we can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/types.html?highlight=methodtype#module-types">MethodType function in the types module</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import types
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters = types.MethodType( barFighters, a )
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters
&lt;bound method ?.barFighters of &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x00A9BC88&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters()
barFighters
</code></pre>

<p>This time other instances of the class have not been affected:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a2.barFighters()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: A instance has no attribute 'barFighters'
</code></pre>

<p>By "generate", I mean auto-generation of the code necessary for a particuliar selected (set of) variable(s).</p>

<p>But any more explicit explication or comment on good practice is welcome.</p>

<p>I don't have Visual Studio installed on my machine anymore (and I'm using Linux), but I do remember that there was an wizard hidden somewhere inside one of the menus that gave access to a class builder.</p>

<p>With this wizard, you could define all your classes' details, including methods and attributes.  If I remember well, there was an option through which you could ask VS to create the setters and getters automatically for you.</p>

<p>I know it's quite vague, but check it out and you might find it.</p>
<p>Rather than using <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd>,<kbd>x</kbd> you can also just type <code>prop</code> and then hit tab twice</p>

<p>I need to send and receive data over serial connections (RS-232 and RS-422).</p>

<p>How do I set up and communicate with such a connection?  How do I figure out what the configuration settings (e.g. baud rate) should be and how do I set them?</p>

<p>In particular I am looking to do this in Java, C/C++, or one of the major Unix shells but I also have some interest in serial programming using Windows/Hyperterminal.</p>
<p>Build a time machine and go back to 1987? Ho ho.</p>

<p>Ok, no more snarky comments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I figure out what the configuration settings (e.g. baud rate) should be...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the datasheet? Ok, ok. Seriously, last one. If you don't know the baud rate of the device you are trying to communicate with, you have two choices. Start guessing, or possibly bust out an o-scope. If you need a good starting point, let me suggest 9600-8-N-1. My suspicion is you can get there with brute force relatively quickly. There's a third option of having an old-school ninja who can tell just by the LOOK of the garbled characters at some standard baud rate what actual baud rate is. An impressive party trick to be sure.</p>

<p>Hopefully though you have access to this information. In unix/linux, you can get ahold of minicom to play with the serial port directly. This should make it fairly quick to get the configuration figured out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>one of the major Unix shells</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Unix the serial port(s) is/are file-mapped into the /dev/ subdir. ttyS0, for example. If you setup the correct baud rate and whatnot using minicom, you can even cat stuff to that file to send stuff out there.</p>

<p>On to the meat of the question, you can access it programmatically through the POSIX headers. termios.h is the big one. </p>

<p><strike>See: <a href="http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html#3_1" rel="nofollow">http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html#3_1</a></strike>
<strong>(NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but I also have some interest in serial programming using Windows/Hyperterminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hyperterminal and minicom are basically the same program. As for how Windows let's you get access to the serial port, I'll leave that question for someone else. I haven't done that in Windows since the Win95 days.</p>

<p>What is the best way to go about calling a function given a string with the function's name in a Python program.  For example, let's say that I have a module <code>foo</code>, and I have a string whose contents are <code>"bar"</code>. What is the best way to go about calling <code>foo.bar()</code>?</p>

<p>I need to get the return value of the function, which is why I don't just use <code>eval</code>. I figured out how to do it by using <code>eval</code> to define a temp function that returns the result of that function call, but I'm hoping that there is a more elegant way to do this.</p>

<p>Assuming module <code>foo</code> with method <code>bar</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import foo
methodToCall = getattr(foo, 'bar')
result = methodToCall()
</code></pre>

<p>As far as that goes, lines 2 and 3 can be compressed to:</p>

<pre><code>result = getattr(foo, 'bar')()
</code></pre>

<p>if that makes more sense for your use case.  You can use <code>getattr</code> in this fashion on class instance bound methods, module-level methods, class methods... the list goes on.</p>

<p>I wound up just implementing the translation manually.  The code's not too bad, but it did leave me wishing that they provided support for it directly.  I could see such a method being useful in a lot of different circumstances.</p>

<p>I guess that's why they added extension methods :)</p>

<p>In pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>// Recompute the image scaling the zoom mode uses to fit the image on screen
imageScale ::= min(pictureBox.width / image.width, pictureBox.height / image.height)

scaledWidth  ::= image.width * imageScale
scaledHeight ::= image.height * imageScale

// Compute the offset of the image to center it in the picture box
imageX ::= (pictureBox.width - scaledWidth) / 2
imageY ::= (pictureBox.height - scaledHeight) / 2

// Test the coordinate in the picture box against the image bounds
if pos.x &lt; imageX or imageX + scaledWidth &lt; pos.x then return null
if pos.y &lt; imageY or imageY + scaledHeight &lt; pos.y then return null

// Compute the normalized (0..1) coordinates in image space
u ::= (pos.x - imageX) / imageScale
v ::= (pos.y - imageY) / imageScale
return (u, v)
</code></pre>

<p>To get the pixel position in the image, you'd just multiply by the actual image pixel dimensions, but the normalized coordinates allow you to address the original responder's point about resolving ambiguity on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><strong>Original Question</strong></p>

<p>I am currently engaged in teaching my brother to program.  He is a total beginner, but very smart. (And he actually wants to learn).  I've noticed that some of our sessions have gotten bogged down in minor details, and I don't feel I've been very organized. (<em>But the answers to this post have helped a lot.</em>)</p>

<p>What can I do better to teach him effectively?  Is there a logical order that I can use to run through concept by concept?  Are there complexities I should avoid till later?</p>

<p>The language we are working with is <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, but advice in any language is welcome.</p>

<p>At work we use teraterm and realterm for checking serial data is correctly formatted. Also we have a hardware splitter with a switch so we can monitor traffic to our application via a cable back to another port.</p>

<p>Windows allows you access to the serial port via CreateFile. That gives you a handle and from there you can configure access.</p>
<p>I would actually argue to pick a simpler language with fewer instructions.  I personally learned on BASIC at home, as <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001104.html" rel="nofollow">did Jeff</a>.  This way, you don't have to delve into more complicated issues like object oriented programming, or even procedures if you don't want to.  Once he can handle simple control flow, then move on to something a little more complicated, but only simple features.</p>

<p>Maybe start with very simple programs that just add 2 numbers, and then grow to something that might require a branch, then maybe reading input and responding to it, then some kind of loop, and start combining them all together.  Just start little and work your way up.  Don't do any big projects until he can grasp the fundamentals (otherwise it may very well be too daunting and he could give up midway).  Once he's mastered BASIC or whatever you choose, move on to something more complicated.</p>

<p>Just my $0.02</p>
<p>Something you should be very mindful of while teaching your brother to program is for him not to rely too heavily on you. Often when I find myself helping others they will begin to think of me as answer book to all of their questions and instead of experimenting to find an answer they simply ask me. Often the best teacher is experimentation and every time your brother has a question like "What will happen if I add 2 to a string?" you should tell him to try it out and see for himself. Also I have noticed that when I cannot get a concept through to someone, it helps to see some sample code where we can look at each segment individually and explain it piece by piece. As a side note people new to programming often have trouble with the idea of object oriented programming, they will say they understand it when you teach it to them but will not get a clear concept of it until actually implementing it.</p>
<p>You could try using <a href="http://www.alice.org/" rel="nofollow">Alice</a>.  It's a 3D program designed for use in introductory programming classes.</p>

<p>The two biggest obstacles for new programmers are often:</p>

<ul>
<li>syntax errors</li>
<li>motivation (writing something meaningful and fun rather than contrived)</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice uses a drag and drop interface for constructing programs, avoiding the possibility of syntax errors.  Alice lets you construct 3D worlds and have your code control (simple) 3D characters and animation, which is usually a lot more interesting than implementing linked lists.</p>

<p>Experienced programmers may look down at Alice as a toy and scoff at dragging and dropping lines of code, but <a href="http://www.alice.org/index.php?page=publications/publications" rel="nofollow">research</a> shows that this approach works.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I worked on Alice.</p>
<p>A good python course is MIT's <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-189January--IAP--2008/CourseHome/" rel="nofollow" title="Araxis Merge">A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python</a>.

<p>I use Hpricot on Ruby. As an example this is a snippet of code that I use to retrieve all book titles from the six pages of my HireThings account (as they don't seem to provide a single page with this information):</p>

<pre><code>pagerange = 1..6
proxy = Net::HTTP::Proxy(proxy, port, user, pwd)
proxy.start('www.hirethings.co.nz') do |http|
  pagerange.each do |page|
    resp, data = http.get "/perth_dotnet?page=#{page}" 
    if resp.class == Net::HTTPOK
      (Hpricot(data)/"h3 a").each { |a| puts a.innerText }
    end
  end
end 
</code></pre>

<p>It's pretty much complete. All that comes before this are library imports and the settings for my proxy.</p>

<p>I've had to work with several beginner (never wrote a line of code) programmers, and I'll be doing an after school workshop with high school students this fall. This is the closest thing I've got to documentation. It's still a work in progress, but I hope it helps.</p>

<p>1) <b>FizzBuzz.</b> Start with command line programs. You can write some fun games, or tools, very quickly, and you learn all of the language features very quickly without having to learn the GUI tools first. These early apps should be simple enough that you won't need to use any real debugging tools to make them work.</p>

<p>If nothing else things like FizzBuzz are good projects. Your first few apps should not have to deal with DBs, file system, configuration, ect. These are concepts which just confuse most people, and when you're just learning the syntax and basic framework features you really don't need more complexity.</p>

<p>Some projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hello World!</li>
<li>Take the year of my birth, and calculate my age (just (now - then) no month corrections). <i>(simple math, input, output)</i></li>
<li>Ask for a direction(Up, down, left, right), then tell the user their fate (fall in a hole, find a cake, ect). <i>(Boolean logic)</i></li>
<li>FizzBuzz, but count once every second. <i>(Loops, timers, and more logic)</i></li>
<li>Depending on their age some really like an app which calls the users a random insult at some interval. <i>(Loops, arrays, timers, and random if you make the interval random)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>2) <b>Simple Project</b> Once they have a good grasp of language features, you can start a project(simple, fun games work good.). You should try to have the first project be able to be completed within 6-12 hours. Don't spend time to architect it early. Let them design it even if it sucks. If it falls apart, talk about what happened and why it failed, then pick another topic and start again.</p>

<p>This is where you start introducing the debugging capabilities of your tools. Even if you can see the problem by reading the code you should teach them how to use the tools, and then show them how you could see it. That serves the dual purpose of teaching the debugging tools and teaching how to ID errors without tools.</p>

<p>Once, or if, the project gets functional you can use it to introduce refactoring tools. Its good if you can then expand the project with some simple features which you never planned for. This usually means refactoring and significant debugging, since very few people write even half decent code their first time.</p>

<p>Some projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hangman game</li>
<li>Experimenting with robotics(<a href="http://www.vexlabs.com" rel="nofollow">Vex</a> and <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com" rel="nofollow">Mindstorms</a> are options) </li>
</ul>

<p>3) <b>Real Project </b> Start a real project which may take some time. Use proper source control, and make a point to have a schedule. Run this project like a real project, if nothing else its good experience having to deal with the tools.</p>

<p>Obviously you need to adjust this for each person. The most important thing I've found is to make even the first simple apps apply to what the person is interested in. </p>

<p>Some projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tetris</li>
<li>Text file based blog engine</li>
<li>More advanced robotics work</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to teach the basics of programming, without being language specific, there is an application called <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">Scratch</a> that was created in MIT. It's designed to help people  develop programming skills. As users create Scratch projects, they learn to create conditions, loops, etc. There is a also a community of scratch projects, form which projects can be downloaded - that way you can explore other people's programs and see how they were built.</p>
<p>I'm having trouble figuring out how to get the testing framework set up and usable in Visual Studio 2008 for C++ presumably with the built-in unit testing suite.</p>

<p>Any links or tutorials would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/unittest-cpp" rel="nofollow">UnitTest++</a>.</p>

<p>In the years since I made this post the source has moved from SourceForge to github.  Also the <a href="https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/wiki/Writing-More-Tests-With-the-Bowling-Game-Kata" rel="nofollow">example tutorial</a> is now more agnostic - doesn't go into any configuration or project set up at all.</p>

<p>I doubt it will still work for Visual Studio 6 as the project files are now created via CMake. If you still need the older version support you can get the last available version under the <a href="https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/tree/sourceforge" rel="nofollow">SourceForge</a> branch.</p>

<p>I recently wrote an article titled <a href="http://woarl.com/girlfriend.html" rel="nofollow">How to teach your girlfriend programming</a>, it has little to do with girlfriends and everything about teaching something technical to someone that does not understand it.</p>

<p>I'm told it's also funny.</p>

<p>CSS and Javascript files don't change very often, so I want them to be cached by the web browser. But I also want the web browser to see changes made to these files without requiring the user to clear their browser cache. Also want a solution that works well with a version control system such as Subversion.</p>

<p>You could use the SVN revision number to automate this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2308/aspnet-display-svn-revision-number">for you</a> by including the word <strong>LastChangedRevision</strong> in your html file after where v1 appears above.

<p>Firefox also allows pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to reload everything on a particular page.</p>

<p>How would one display any add content from a "dynamic" aspx page? Currently I am working on using the System.Web.HttpResponse "Page.Response" to write a file that is stored on a web server to a web request.</p>

<p>This would allow people to hit a url to the type <a href="http://www.foo.com?Image=test.jpg">http://www.foo.com?Image=test.jpg</a> and have the image display in their browser. So as you may know this revolves around the use of Response.ContentType.</p>

<p>By using </p>

<pre><code>Response.ContentType = "application/octet-stream";
</code></pre>

<p>I am able to display images of type gif/jpeg/png (all i have tested so far), bit trying to display .swf or .ico files gives me a nice little error.</p>

<p>using</p>

<pre><code>Response.ContentType = "application/x-shockwave-flash";
</code></pre>

<p>I can get flash files to play, but then the images are messed.</p>

<p>So how do i <strong>easily</strong> choose the contenttype?</p>

<p>This is part of a solution I use on a local intranet. Some of the variables you will have to collect yourself as I pull them from a database but you may pull them from somewhere else.</p>

<p>The only extra but I've got in there is a function called <strong>getMimeType</strong> which connects to the database and pulls back the correct mine type based on file extension. This defaults to application/octet-stream if none is found.</p>

<pre><code>// Clear the response buffer incase there is anything already in it.<br>Response.Clear();<br>Response.Buffer = true;<br><br>// Read the original file from disk<br>FileStream myFileStream = new FileStream(sPath, FileMode.Open);<br>long FileSize = myFileStream.Length;<br>byte[] Buffer = new byte[(int)FileSize];<br>myFileStream.Read(Buffer, 0, (int)FileSize);<br>myFileStream.Close();<br><br>// Tell the browse stuff about the file<br>Response.AddHeader("Content-Length", FileSize.ToString());<br>Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", "inline; filename=" + sFilename.Replace(" ","_"));<br>Response.ContentType = getMimeType(sExtention, oConnection);<br><br>// Send the data to the browser<br>Response.BinaryWrite(Buffer);<br>Response.End();<br></code></pre>
<p>This is the version we use here. It works, and it's fairly simple. It's the same idea as Jeff's but I think it's a little clearer because it separates out the logic for subtracting one, so it's a little easier to understand.</p>

<pre><code>public static int GetAge(this DateTime dateOfBirth, DateTime dateAsAt)
{
    return dateAsAt.Year - dateOfBirth.Year - (dateOfBirth.DayOfYear &lt; dateAsAt.DayOfYear ? 0 : 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could expand the ternary operator to make it even clearer, if you think that sort of thing is unclear.</p>

<p>Obviously this is done as an extension method on <code>DateTime</code>, but clearly you can grab that one line of code that does the work and put it anywhere. Here we have another overload of the Extension method that passes in <code>DateTime.Now</code>, just for completeness.</p>

<p>In Java there are two basic types in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/Concepts.doc.html#22930">JVM</a>. 1) Primitive types and 2) Reference Types. int is a primitive type and Integer is a class type (which is kind of reference type).</p>

<p>Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values. A variable whose type is a primitive type always holds a primitive value of that type.</p>

<pre><code>int aNumber = 4;
int anotherNum = aNumber;
aNumber += 6;
System.out.println(anotherNum); // Prints 4
</code></pre>

<p>An object is a dynamically created class instance or an array. The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects and a special null reference, which refers to no object. There may be many references to the same object.</p>

<pre><code>Integer aNumber = Integer.valueOf(4);
Integer anotherNumber = aNumber; // anotherNumber references the 
                                 // same object as aNumber
</code></pre>

<p>Also in Java everything is passed by value. With objects the value that is passed is the reference to the object. So another difference between int and Integer in java is how they are passed in method calls. For example in</p>

<pre><code>public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
final int two = 2;
int sum = add(1, two);
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <em>two</em> is passed as the primitive integer type 2. Whereas in</p>

<pre><code>public int add(Integer a, Integer b) {
    return a.intValue() + b.intValue();
}
final Integer two = Integer.valueOf(2);
int sum = add(Integer.valueOf(1), two);
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <em>two</em> is passed as a reference to an object that holds the integer value 2.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>@WolfmanDragon:
Pass by reference would work like so:</p>

<pre><code>public void increment(int x) {
  x = x + 1;
}
int a = 1;
increment(a);
// a is now 2
</code></pre>

<p>When increment is called it passes a reference (pointer) to variable <em>a</em>. And the <em>increment</em> function directly modifies variable <em>a</em>.</p>

<p>And for object types it would work as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public void increment(Integer x) {
  x = Integer.valueOf(x.intValue() + 1);
}
Integer a = Integer.valueOf(1);
increment(a);
// a is now 2
</code></pre>

<p>Do you see the difference now?</p>

You'd be looking to static link (as opposed to dynamically link)

I'm not sure how many of the MS redistributables statically link in.
<p>I need to set the height of every textbox on my form, some of which are nested within other controls.  I thought I could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>private static IEnumerator&lt;TextBox&gt; FindTextBoxes(Control rootControl)
{
    foreach (Control control in rootControl.Controls)
    {
        if (control.Controls.Count &gt; 0)
        {
            // Recursively search for any TextBoxes within each child control
            foreach (TextBox textBox in FindTextBoxes(control))
            {
                yield return textBox;
            }
        }

        TextBox textBox2 = control as TextBox;
        if (textBox2 != null)
        {
            yield return textBox2;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using it like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(TextBox textBox in FindTextBoxes(this))
{
    textBox.Height = height;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But of course the compiler spits its dummy, because <em>foreach</em> expects an <strong>IEnumerable</strong> rather than an <strong>IEnumerator</strong>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this without having to create a separate class with a <strong>GetEnumerator()</strong> method?</p>

<p>As the compiler is telling you, you need to change your return type to IEnumerable. That is how the yield return syntax works.</p>
<p>How can I set the CSS background color of an HTML element using JavaScript?</p>

<pre><code>var element = document.getElementById('element');<br>element.style.background = '#ff00aa';<br></code></pre>
<p>In general, CSS properties are converted to JavaScript by making them camelCase without any dashes. So <code>background-color</code> becomes <code>backgroundColor</code>.</p>

<pre><code>function setColor(element, color)
{
    element.style.backgroundColor = color;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>// Generic function that gets all child controls of a certain type, 
// returned in a List collection
private static List&lt;T&gt; GetChildTextBoxes&lt;T&gt;(Control ctrl) where T : Control{
    List&lt;T&gt; tbs = new List&lt;T&gt;();
    foreach (Control c in ctrl.Controls) {
        // If c is of type T, add it to the collection
        if (c is T) { 
            tbs.Add((T)c);
        }
    }
    return tbs;
}

private static void SetChildTextBoxesHeight(Control ctrl, int height) {
    foreach (TextBox t in GetChildTextBoxes&lt;TextBox&gt;(ctrl)) {
        t.Height = height;
    }
}

<p>I have same problems in my work (we also use <code>VC6</code> sometimes). And there is no easy solution for it. I have only some hints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try with automatic crash dumps on production machine (see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e089ca41-6a87-40c8-bf69-28ac08570b7e&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">Process Dumper</a>). My experience says Dr. Watson is <strong>not perfect</strong> for dumping.</li>
<li>Remove all <strong>catch(...)</strong> from your code. They often hide serious memory exceptions.</li>
<li>Check <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321374460" rel="nofollow">Advanced Windows Debugging</a> - there are lots of great tips for problems like yours. I recomend this with all my heart.</li>
<li>If you use <code>STL</code> try <code>STLPort</code> and checked builds. Invalid iterator are hell.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck. Problems like yours take us months to solve. Be ready for this...</p>

<P>If you return IEnumerator, it will be a different enumerator object each time call that method (acting as though you reset the enumerator on each iteration). If you return IEnumerable then a foreach can enumerate based on the method with the yield statement.</P>
<p>I would like to be able to use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key within the a text box to tab over four spaces. The way it is now, the Tab key jumps my cursor to the next input.</p>

<p>Is there some JavaScript that will capture the Tab key in the text box before it bubbles up to the UI?</p>

<p>I understand some browsers (i.e. FireFox) may not allow this. How about a custom key-combo like <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>?</p>

<p>The previous answer is fine, but I'm one of those guys that's firmly against mixing behavior with presentation (putting JavaScript in my HTML) so I prefer to put my event handling logic in my JavaScript files. Additionally, not all browsers implement event (or e) the same way. You may want to do a check prior to running any logic:</p>

<pre><code>document.onkeydown = TabExample;<br><br>function TabExample(evt) {<br><br>    var evt = (evt) ? evt : ((event) ? event : null);<br>    if(evt.keycode == 9) {<br><br>        // do work<br><br>    }<br><br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>I'd rather tab indentation not work than breaking tabbing between form items.</p>

<p>If you want to indent to put in code in the Markdown box, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> (or K on a Mac).</p>

<p>In terms of actually stopping the action, jQuery (which Stack Overflow uses) will stop an event from bubbling when you return false from an event callback. This makes life easier for working with multiple browsers.</p>

<p>I would advise against changing the default behaviour of a key.  I do as much as possible without touching a mouse, so if you make my tab key not move to the next field on a form I will be very aggravated.</p>

<p>A shortcut key could be useful however, especially with large code blocks and nesting.  Shift-TAB is a bad option because that normally takes me to the previous field on a form.  Maybe a new button on the WMD editor to insert a code-TAB, with a shortcut key, would be possible?</p>
<p>I know that we can get the MAC address of a user via IE (ActiveX objects).</p>

<p>Is there a way to do the same thing in all browsers? (Especially since FF is gaining browser share everyday!)</p>
<p>If this is for an intranet application and all of the clients use DHCP, you can query the DHCP server for the MAC address for a given IP address.</p>
<p>One more thing that I don't see in previous answers:
In Java the primitive wrappers classes like Integer, Double, Float, Boolean... and String are suposed to be invariant, so that when you pass an instance of those classes the invoked method couldn't alter your data in any way, in opositin with most of other classes, which internal data could be altered by its public methods. So that this classes only has 'getter' methods, no 'setters', besides the constructor.</p>

<p>In a java program String literals are stored in a separate portion of heap memory, only a instance for literal, to save memory reusing those instances</p>

<p>i can be wrong because i'm autodidact, but i NEVER user public properties in my Java clases, they are allways private or protected, so that outside code must access by getters/setters. it's better for mainteance / modification purposes. And for inside class code... if getter method is trivial i use the property directly, but i allways use the setter methods because i could easily add code to fire events if i wish</p>
<p>I'm using MSVE, and I have my own tiles I'm displaying in layers on top. Problem is, there's a ton of them, and they're on a network server. In certain directories, there are something on the order of 30,000+ files. Initially I called Directory.GetFiles, but once I started testing in a pseudo-real environment, it timed out.</p>

<p>What's the best way to programatically list, and iterate through, this many files?</p>

<p>Edit: My coworker suggested using the MS indexing service. Has anyone tried this approach, and (how) has it worked?</p>

<p>I've worked on a SAN system in the past with telephony audio recordings which had issues with numbers of files in a single folder - that system became unusable somewhere near 5,000 (on Windows 2000 Advanced Server with an application in C#.Net 1.1)- the only sensible solution that we came up with was to change the folder structure so that there were a more reasonable number of files. Interestingly Explorer would also time out!</p>

<p>The convention we came up with was a structure that broke the structure up in years, months and days - but that will depend upon your system and whether you can control the directory structure...</p>
<p>Nope. The reason ActiveX can do it is because ActiveX is a little application that runs on the client's machine.</p>

<p>I would imagine access to such information via JavaScript would be a security vulnerability.</p>
<p>When the separator String for the command is allways the same String or char (like the ";") y recomend you use the StrinkTokenizer class:</p>

<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/StringTokenizer.html" rel="nofollow">StringTokenizer</a></p>

<p>but when the separator varies or is complex y recomend you to use the regular expresions, wich can be used by the String class itself, method split, since 1.4. It uses the Pattern class from the java.util.regex package</p>

<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html" rel="nofollow">Pattern</a></p>

<p>I agree with Leac.  I actually play with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">Scratch</a> sometimes if I'm bored.  It's a pretty fun visual way of looking at code.</p>

<p>How it works is, they give you a bunch of "blocks" (these look like legos) which you can stack.  And by stacking these blocks, and interacting with the canvas (where you put your sprites, graphics), you can create games, movies, slideshows... it's really interesting.</p>

<p>When it's complete you can upload it right to the Scratch websites, which is a youtube-ish portal for Scratch applications.  Not only that, but you can download any submission on the website, and learn from or extend other Scratch applications.</p>
<p>I have a simple setter method for a property and <code>null</code> is not appropriate for this particular property. I have always been torn in this situation: should I throw an <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html"><code>IllegalArgumentException</code></a>, or a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html"><code>NullPointerException</code></a>? From the javadocs, both seem appropriate. Is there some kind of an understood standard?  Or is this just one of those things that you should do whatever you prefer and both are really correct?</p>

<p>If it's a <code>setter</code> method and <code>null</code> is being passed to it, I think it would make more sense to throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>. A <code>NullPointerException</code> seems to make more sense in the case where you're attempting to actually use the <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>So, if you're using it and it's <code>null</code>, <code>NullPointer</code>. If it's being passed in and it's <code>null</code>, <code>IllegalArgument</code>.</p>

<p>Since the WMI class Win32_OperatingSystem only includes OSArchitecture in Windows Vista, I quickly wrote up a method using the registry to try and determine whether or not the current system is a 32 or 64bit system.</p>

<pre><code>private Boolean is64BitOperatingSystem()
{
    RegistryKey localEnvironment = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey("SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment");
    String processorArchitecture = (String) localEnvironment.GetValue("PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE");

    if (processorArchitecture.Equals("x86")) {
        return false;
    }
    else {
        return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's worked out pretty well for us so far, but I'm not sure how much I like looking through the registry. Is this a pretty standard practice or is there a better method?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Wow, that code looks a lot prettier in the preview. I'll consider linking to a pastebin or something, next time.</p>

<p>Looking into the registry is perfectly valid, so long as you can be sure that the user of the application will always have access to what you need.</p>
<p>Take a look at Raymond Chens solution:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/01/364563.aspx" rel="nofollow">How to detect programmatically whether you are running on 64-bit Windows</a></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'd take issue with checking for 'x86'. Who's to say what intel's or AMD's next 32 bit processor may be designated as. The probability is low but it is a risk. You should ask the OS to determine this via the correct API's, not by querying what could be a OS version/platform specific value that may be considered opaque to the outside world. Ask yourself the questions, 1 - is the registry entry concerned properly documented by MS, 2 - If it is do they provide a definitive list of possible values that is guaranteed to permit you as a developer to make the informed decision between whether you are running 32 bit or 64 bit. If the answer is no, then call the API's, yeah it's a but more long winded but it is documented and definitive. </p>

<P>The easiest way to test for 64-bit under .NET is to check the value of IntPtr.Size.</P>
<P>EDIT: Doh! This will tell you whether or not the current process is 64-bit, not the OS as a whole. Sorry!</P>

<p>What profilers have you used when working with .net programs, and which would you particularly recommend?</p>
<p>I've been working with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/" rel="nofollow">JetBrains dotTrace</a> for WinForms and Console Apps (not tested on ASP.net yet), and it works quite well:</p>

<p>They recently also added a "Personal License" that is significantly cheaper than the corporate one. Still, if anyone else knows some cheaper or even free ones, I'd like to hear as well :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_profiler/index.htm" rel="nofollow">ANTS Profiler</a>. I haven't used many, but I don't really have any complaints about ANTS. The visualization is really helpful.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it is better to make the version number part of the file itself.  e.g. myscript.1.2.3.js  You can set your webserver to cache this file forever, and just add a new js file when you have a new version.</p>

<p>I started a build.xml for a project that generates a JAR file but stopped there and I need real examples to compare notes. My good friends! I don't have anyone close to chat about this! </p>

<p>This is my <a href="http://pastebin.ca/1094382">build.xml</a> so far. </p>

<p><i>(*) I edited my question based in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4046/can-someone-give-me-a-working-example-of-a-buildxml-for-an-ear-that-deploys-in-#4298">suggestion</a> of to use pastebin.ca</i></p>
<p>I have an application that writes information to file. This information is used post-execution to determine pass/failure/correctness of the application. I'd like to be able to read the file as it is being written so that I can do these pass/failure/correctness checks in realtime.</p>

<p>I assume it is possible to do this, but what are the gotchas involved when using Java? If the reading catches up to the writing, will it just wait for more writes up until the file is closed, or will the read throw an exception at this point? If the latter, what do I do then? </p>

<p>My intuition is currently pushing me towards BufferedStreams. Is this the way to go?</p>

<p>Not Java per-se, but you may run into issues where you have written something to a file, but it hasn't been actually written yet - it might be in a cache somewhere, and reading from the same file may not actually give you the new information.</p>

<p>Short version - use flush() or whatever the relevant system call is to ensure that your data is actually written to the file.</p>

<p>Note I am not talking about the OS level disk cache - if your data gets into here, it should appear in a read() after this point.  It may be that the language itself caches writes, waiting until a buffer fills up or file is flushed/closed.</p>
<p>I've never tried it, but you should write a test case to see if reading from a stream after you have hit the end will work, regardless of if there is more data written to the file.</p>

<p>Is there a reason you can't use a piped input/output stream?  Is the data being written and read from the same application (if so, you have the data, why do you need to read from the file)?</p>

<p>Otherwise, maybe read till end of file, then monitor for changes and seek to where you left off and continue... though watch out for race conditions.</p>
<p>I'd like to use a <code>LinqDataSource</code> control on a page and limit the amount of records returned.  I know if I use code behind I could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; values = Enumerable.Range(0, 10);
IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; take3 = values.Take(3);
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know if something like this is possible with a <code>LinqDataSource</code> control?</p>

<p><strong>[Update]</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to use the <code>LinqDataSource</code> with the <code>ListView</code> control, <em>not</em> a GridView or Repeater.  The <code>LinqDataSource</code> wizard does not provide the ability to limit the number of records return.  The Advanced options only allow you to enabled deletes, inserts, and updates.</p>

<p>I know that if you use a paging repeater or gridview with the linqdatasource it will automatically optimize the number of results returned, but I'm also pretty sure in the datasource wizard you can go to advanced options and limit it to </p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP 3 FROM 
</code></pre>

<p>which should allow you to do what you need</p>

<p>So my company stores alot of data in a foxpro database and trying to get around the performance hit of touching it directly I was thinking of messaging anything that can be done asynchronously for a snappier user experience.  I started looking at <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/">ActiveMQ</a> but don't know how well C# will hook with it.  Wanting to hear what all of you guys think.</p>

<p>edit : It is going to be a web application.  Anything touching this foxpro is kinda slow (probably because the person who set it up 10 years ago messed it all to hell, some of the table files are incredibly large).  We replicate the foxpro to sql nightly and most of our data reads are ok being a day old so we are focusing on the writes. plus the write affects a critical part of the user experience (purchasing), we store it in sql and then just message to have it put into foxpro when it can.  I wish we could just get rid of the foxpro, unfortunately the company doesn't want to get rid of a very old piece of software they bought that depends on it.</p>
<p>I want to convert a primitive to a string, and I tried:</p>

<pre><code>myInt.toString();
</code></pre>

<p>This fails with the error:</p>

<pre><code>int cannot be dereferenced
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I get that primitives are not reference types (ie, not an Object) and so cannot have methods.  However, Java 5 introduced autoboxing and unboxing (a la C#... which I never liked in C#, but that's beside the point).  So with autoboxing, I would expect the above to convert myInt to an Integer and then call toString() on that.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I believe C# allows such a call, unless I remember incorrectly.  Is this just an unfortunate shortcoming of Java's autoboxing/unboxing specification, or is there a good reason for this?</p>

<p>Ditto on what Justin said, but you should do this instead:</p>

<pre><code>Integer.toString(myInt);
</code></pre>

<p>It saves an allocation or two and is more readable.</p>

<p>ActiveMQ works well with C# using the Spring.NET integrations and NMS.

Also consider using MSMQ (The System.Messaging namespace) or a .NET based asynchronous messaging solution, with <a href="http://thefreakparade.com/2008/06/03/esbs-for-the-microsoft-net-platform/" rel="nofollow">some options here</a>.</p>
<p>I would say mbUnit also, I like being able to run a single test many times just by specifying inputs and result right above the test function.

<p>Is there anyway to configure a WCF service with a failover endpoint if the primary endpoint dies? Kind of like being able to specify a failover server in a SQL cluster.</p>

<p>Specifically I am using the TCP/IP binding for speed, but on the rare occurrence that the machine is not available I would like to redirect traffic to the failover server. Not too bothered about losing messages. I'd just prefer not to write the code to handle re-routing.</p>

<P>Without trying to sound too vague but I think Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) should handle this for you.</P>
<p>I have experience writing console and network client/server applications in C and C++, but I know next to nothing about using the win32 visual API, MFC, Qt, wxWidgets, etc.  Where is a good place to start, and what method should I specialize in, so as to be future ready and robust?</p>

<p>I don't know if I'd call it a good place to start, but if you want to be future ready, take a look at the <a href="http://windowsclient.net/">windows presentation foundation</a> which is built entirely for the purpose of programming GUI's for windows</p>
<p>Any suggestions?  Using visual studio in C#.</p>

<p>Are there any specific tools to use or methods to approach this?</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Sorry, I should have been a little more specific. I am using ASP.Net 2.0 and was looking more for a tool like jUnit for Java. I took a look at NUnit and NUnitAsp and that looks very promising. And I didn't even know that Visual Studio Pro has a testing suite, so I'll look at all of these options (I've just started using Visual Studio/Asp.net/C# this summer).</p>

<p>I think you should definitely throw a IllegalArgumentException and thus fail-fast. Let other developers know by marking it in the JavaDocs and also define constraints on your methods, so that they see what happens when they pass an invalid objects. I <a href="http://dlinsin.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-to-fail-fast-on-faulty-injection.html" rel="nofollow">wrote about this</a> a couple of weeks ago, if you want to follow up.</p>

<P>Keep in mind that TempData stores the form collection in session. If you don't like that behavior, you can implement the new ITempDataProvider interface and use some other mechanism for storing temp data. I wouldn't do that unless you know for a fact (via measurement and profiling) that the use of Session state is hurting you.</P>
<p>This is a fantastic book which my little brothers used to learn:</p>

<p><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" rel="nofollow">http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/</a></p>

<p>Of course, the most important thing is to start on a real, useful program of some kind IMMEDIATELY after finishing the book.</p>
<p>I recommend starting them off with C/C++.  I find that it is a good foundation for just about every other language.  Also, the different versions of BASIC can be pretty dodgy, at best, and have no real correlation to actual programming.</p>
<p>Typical way of creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" rel="nofollow">CSV</a> string (pseudocode):</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a CSV container object (like a StringBuilder in C#).</li>
<li>Loop through the strings you want to add appending a comma after each one.</li>
<li>After the loop, remove that last superfluous comma.</li>
</ol>

<p>Code sample:</p>

<pre><code>public string ReturnAsCSV(ContactList contactList)
{
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    foreach (Contact c in contactList)
    {
        sb.Append(c.Name + ",");
    }

    sb.Remove(sb.Length - 1, 1);
    //sb.Replace(",", "", sb.Length - 1, 1)

    return sb.ToString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I like the idea of adding the comma by checking if the container is empty, but doesn't that mean more processing as it needs to check the length of the string on each occurrence?</p>

<p>I feel that there should be an easier/cleaner/more efficient way of removing that last comma. Any ideas?</p>

<p>You could instead add the comma as the first thing inside your foreach.</p>

<p><code>if (sb.Length &gt; 0) sb.Append(",");</code></p>

<p>How about tracking whether you are on the first item, and only add a comma <em>before</em> the item if it is not the first one.</p>

<pre><code>public string ReturnAsCSV(ContactList contactList)
{
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    bool isFirst = true;

    foreach (Contact c in contactList) {
        if (!isFirst) { 
          // Only add comma before item if it is not the first item
          sb.Append(","); 
        } else {
          isFirst = false;
        }

        sb.Append(c.Name);
    }

    return sb.ToString();
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;?php<br>    $outputString = implode(',', $array);<br>?&gt;<br></code></pre>

<p>Sorry, PHP specific example, but might help somebody.</p>

<p>You're prematurely optimizing, the performance hit would be negligible.</p>
<p>The answer seems to be "no" ... and "yes". There seems to be no real way to know if a file is open for writing by another application. So, reading from such a file will just progress until content is exhausted. I took Mike's advice and wrote some test code:</p>

<p>Writer.java writes a string to file and then waits for the user to hit enter before writing another line to file. The idea being that it could be started up, then a reader can be started to see how it copes with the "partial" file. The reader I wrote is in Reader.java.</p>

<p><strong>Writer.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class Writer extends Object<br>{<br>    Writer () {<br><br>    }<br><br>    public static String[] strings = <br>        {<br>            "Hello World", <br>            "Goodbye World"<br>        };<br><br>    public static void main(String[] args) <br>        throws java.io.IOException {<br><br>        java.io.PrintWriter pw =<br>            new java.io.PrintWriter(new java.io.FileOutputStream("out.txt"), true);<br><br>        for(String s : strings) {<br>            pw.println(s);<br>            System.in.read();<br>        }<br><br>        pw.close();<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p><strong>Reader.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class Reader extends Object<br>{<br>    Reader () {<br><br>    }<br><br>    public static void main(String[] args) <br>        throws Exception {<br><br>        java.io.FileInputStream in = new java.io.FileInputStream("out.txt");<br><br>        java.nio.channels.FileChannel fc = in.getChannel();<br>        java.nio.ByteBuffer bb = java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocate(10);<br><br>        while(fc.read(bb) &gt;= 0) {<br>            bb.flip();<br>            while(bb.hasRemaining()) {<br>                System.out.println((char)bb.get());<br>            }<br>            bb.clear();<br>        }<br><br>        System.exit(0);<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>No guarantees that this code is best practice.</p>

<p>This leaves the option suggested by Mike of periodically checking if there is new data to be read from the file. This then requires user intervention to close the file reader when it is determined that the reading is completed. Or, the reader needs to be made aware the content of the file and be able to determine and end of write condition. If the content were XML, the end of document could be used to signal this.</p>
<p>You could also make an array of <strong>c.Name</strong> data and use <strong>String.Join</strong> method to create your line.</p>

<pre><code>public string ReturnAsCSV(ContactList contactList)
{
    List&lt;String&gt; tmpList = new List&lt;string&gt;();

    foreach (Contact c in contactList)
    {
        tmpList.Add(c.Name);
    }

    return String.Join(",", tmpList.ToArray());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This might not be as performant as the <strong>StringBuilder</strong> approach, but it definitely looks cleaner.</p>

<p>Also, you might want to consider using <strong>.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ListSeparator</strong> instead of a hard-coded comma -- If your output is going to be imported into other applications, you might have problems with it. ListSeparator may be different across different cultures, and MS Excel at the very least, honors this setting. So:</p>

<pre><code>return String.Join(
    System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ListSeparator,
    tmpList.ToArray());
</code></pre>

<p>Im trying to create a bookmarklet for posting del.icio.us bookmarks to a seperate account.</p>

          'delicious','toolbar=no,width=500,height=250'
        )
    );
</code></pre>

<p>but all that happens is that I get this from del.icio.us:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?&gt;
&lt;result code="access denied" /&gt;
&lt;!-- fe04.api.del.ac4.yahoo.net uncompressed/chunked Thu Aug  7 02:02:54 PDT 2008 --&gt;

<p>If I then go to the address bar and press enter, it changes to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version='1.0' standalone='yes'?&gt;
&lt;result code="done" /&gt;
&lt;!-- fe02.api.del.ac4.yahoo.net uncompressed/chunked Thu Aug  7 02:07:45 PDT 2008 --&gt;

<p>I have seen method two implemented in JavaScript with huge performance gains, however, I was unable to measure any gain in C# and was wondering if the compiler already does method 2 even when written like method 1.</p>

<p>The theory behind method 2 is that the code doesn't have to access DataTable.Rows.Count on every iteration, it can simple access the int c.</p>

<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; DataTable.Rows.Count; i++) {
    // Do Something
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0, c = DataTable.Rows.Count; i &lt; c; i++) {
    // Do Something
}
</code></pre>

<p>No, it can't do that since there is no way to express <em>constant over time</em> for a value.</p>

<p>If the compiler should be able to do that, there would have to be a guarantee from the code returning the value that the value is constant, and for the duration of the loop won't change.</p>

<p>But, in this case, you're free to add new rows to the data table as part of your loop, and thus it's up to you to make that guarantee, in the way you have done it.</p>

<p>So in short, the compiler will not do that optimization if the end-index is anything other than a variable.</p>

<p>In the case of a variable, where the compiler can just look at the loop-code and see that this particular variable is not changed, it might do that and load the value into a register before starting the loop, but any performance gain from this would most likely be negligible, unless your loop body is empty.</p>

<p>Conclusion: If you know, or is willing to accept, that the end loop index is constant for the duration of the loop, place it into a variable.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Re-read your post, and yes, you might see negligible performance gains for your two cases as well, because the JITter optimizes the code. The JITter might optimize your end-index read into a direct access to the variable inside the data table that contains the row count, and a memory read isn't all that expensive anyway. If, on the other hand, reading that property was a very expensive operation, you'd see a more noticable difference.</p>
<p>If you're simply displaying data from models, why not use the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/generic-views/" rel="nofollow">Django Generic Views</a>? They're designed to let you easy show data from a model without having to write your own view and stuff about mapping URL paramaters to views, fetching data, handling edge cases, rendering output, etc.</p>

<P>Just a thought, but remember to handle comma's and quotation marks (") in the field values, otherwise your CSV file may break the consumers reader.</P>
<p>Tuples are a quick\flexible way to create <em>composite</em> data-types.
Lists are containers for, well, lists of objects.</p>

<p>For example, you would use a List to store a list of student details in a class.</p>

<p>Each student detail in that list may be a 3-tuple containing their roll number, name and test score.</p>

<pre><code> `[(1,'Mark',86),(2,'John',34)...]`<br></code></pre>

<p>Also, because tuples are immutable they can be used as keys in dictionaries.</p>
<p>This is a rather broad question, as programming GUI applications in Windows can be done in so many ways.</p>

<p>There are two main parts to developing any GUI app: the <strong>language</strong> and the <strong>API/framework</strong>. Considering you're interested in learning to build Windows GUI apps, the language isn't really a point of focus for you. Hence, you should pick a language you already know and work with a framework or API that can be harnessed by your chosen language.</p>

<p>If you want to use C you're pretty much restricted to dealing with the Win32 API yourself, in which case reading <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/157231995X">Petzold</a> or <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0735624240">Richter</a> would be great places to start. The Win32 API can be quite daunting, but it's well worth the effort to learn (imho). There are plenty of tutorials on Win32 on the web, and there's always <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN</a>, with a complete reference/guide to the Win32 API. Make sure you cover not just the API, but other areas such as resources/dialogs as they are building blocks for your Win32 application.</p>

<p>If you want to use C++ you have all of the options that you have when using C plus a few others. I'd recommend going with the Win32 API directly, and then moving on to a known framework such as MFC, Qt, wxWindows or GTK so that you can spend less time working with boilerplate code and instead focus on writing your application logic. The last 3 options I just listed have the added benefit of being cross-platform, so you don't have to worry too much about platform-specific issues. Given that you said you want to work with Windows, I'll assume you're keen to focus on that rather than cross-platform -- so go with MFC, but spend some time with the Win32 API first to get familiar with some of the concepts.</p>

<p>When dealing with MFC and the Win32 API, it's a good idea to try and get a solid understanding of the terminology prior to writing code. For example, you need to understand what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_loop_in_Microsoft_Windows">message pump</a> is, and how it works. You need to know about concepts such as "<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/buttons/nativewin32xpthemes.aspx">owner-drawn</a> controls", and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997565.aspx">subclassing</a>. When you understand these things (and more), you'll find it easier to work with MFC because it uses similar terminology in its class interfaces (eg. you need to know what "translate messages" means before you can understand how and when to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kkbhxcs2%28VS.80%29.aspx">PreTranslateMessage</a>).</p>

<p>You could also use Managed C++ to write .NET GUI applications, but I've read in a few places that Managed C++ wasn't really intended to be used in this manner. Instead it should be used as a gateway between native/unmanaged code and managed code. If you're using .NET it's best to use a .NET language such as VB.NET or C# to build your GUIs.</p>

<p>So if you <em>are</em> going to use .NET, you currently have the choice of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa497342.aspx">WinForms</a> library, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a>. I personally feel that you'd be wasting time learning to build WinForms applications given that WPF is designed to replace it. Over time WPF will become more prevelant and Winforms will most likely die off. WPF has a much richer API set, and doesn't suffer from many of the limitations that Winforms does. If you do choose this route, however, you'll no doubt have to learn <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752059.aspx">XAML</a>, which is a markup language that drives WPF applications. This technology is coming of age, and there are many great places to learn about it. First, there are sites such as <a href="http://learnwpf.com/">LearnWPF</a>, and <a href="http://www.drwpf.com/">DrWPF</a> which have some really great articles. Secondly, there are <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321374479">plenty</a> of <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596510373">quality</a> <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672328917">books</a> on the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590599551">topic</a>.</p>

<p>So, to sum up, once you've picked your language and tech, the path is actually quite easy. Just pick up a book or two, read some blogs, get into some code samples.. and most importantly ... write code. Keep writing, keep making mistakes, and keep learning from them.</p>

<p>As a final note...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In other words, Silverlight. If you don't want to go the MS route you might give Adobe's Flash/Flex a look see. Both Silverlight and Flash/Flex build RIA's. Which I think is where we are headed. They days of Office like apps are numbered</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't agree at all. Silverlight is not the same as WPF. Silverlight is web-specific, and only has a subset of WPF's features. Given that the question asks for Windows GUI apps, Flash/Flex Rich Internet Apps are not really a fitting suggestion. I also don't agree that the days of Rich Client Applications (such as office) are numbered at all.</p>

<p>I hope that helps. Good luck :)</p>
<p>What you're looking for is <code>setattr</code> I believe.
Use this to set an attribute on an object.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def printme(s): print repr(s)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; class A: pass<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; setattr(A,'printme',printme)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.printme() # s becomes the implicit 'self' variable<br>&lt; __ main __ . A instance at 0xABCDEFG&gt;<br></code></pre>
<p>You could also use a more OO approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a base class that does the error handling and calls an abstract method to perform the concrete work. (Template Method pattern)</li>
<li>Create concrete classes for each operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>This has the advantage of naming each type of operation you perform and gives you a Command pattern - operations have been represented as objects.</p>
<p>Patrick's solution is probably the cleanest.
If you need to dynamically pick up the module as well, you can import it like:</p>

<pre><code>m = __import__ ('foo')
func = getattr(m,'bar')
func()
</code></pre>

<p>How is it possible to make prototype methods in C#.Net?</p>

<p>In JavaScript, I can do the following to create a trim method for the string object:</p>

<pre><code>String.prototype.trim = function() {
    return this.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I go about doing this in C#.Net?</p>

<p>Don't forget our old friend "for". It's not as nice-looking as foreach but it has the advantage of being able to start at the second element.</p>

<pre><code>public string ReturnAsCSV(ContactList contactList)
{
    if (contactList == null || contactList.Count == 0)
        return string.Empty;

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(contactList[0].Name);

    for (int i = 1; i &lt; contactList.Count; i++)
    {
        sb.Append(",");
        sb.Append(contactList[i].Name);
    }

    return sb.ToString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could also wrap the second Append in an "if" that tests whether the Name property contains a double-quote or a comma, and if so, escape them appropriately.</p>

<p>Is <em>CompileAssemblyFromDom</em> faster than <em>CompileAssemblyFromSource</em>?</p>

<p>It <em>should</em> be as it presumably bypasses the compiler front-end.</p>
<p>You need to create an extension method, which requires .NET 3.5. The method needs to be static, in a static class. The first parameter of the method needs to be prefixed with "this" in the signature.</p>

<pre><code>public static string MyMethod(this string input)<br>{<br>    // do things<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>You can then call it like</p>

<pre><code>"asdfas".MyMethod();<br></code></pre>
<p>You can't dynamically add methods to existing objects or classes in .NET, except by changing the source for that class.</p>

<p>You can, however, in C# 3.0, use extension methods, which <em>look</em> like new methods, but are compile-time magic.</p>

<p>To do this for your code:</p>

<pre><code>public static class StringExtensions<br>{<br>    public static String trim(this String s)<br>    {<br>        return s.Trim();<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>To use it:</p>

<pre><code>String s = "  Test  ";<br>s = s.trim();<br></code></pre>

<p>This looks like a new method, but will compile the exact same way as this code:</p>

<pre><code>String s = "  Test  ";<br>s = StringExtensions.trim(s);<br></code></pre>

<p>What exactly are you trying to accomplish? Perhaps there are better ways of doing what you want?</p>
<p>Using the 3.5 compiler you can use an Extension Method:</p>

<pre><code>public static void Trim(this string s)<br>{<br>  // implementation<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>You can use this on a CLR 2.0 targeted project (3.5 compiler) by including this hack:</p>

<pre><code>namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices<br>{<br>  [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method | AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Assembly)]<br>  public sealed class ExtensionAttribute : Attribute<br>  {<br>  }<br>}<br></code></pre>
<P>It sounds like you're talking about C#'s Extension Methods. You add functionality to existing classes by inserting the "this" keyword before the first parameter. The method has to be a static method in a static class. Strings in .NET already have a "Trim" method, so I'll use another example.</P><PRE><CODE>public static class MyStringEtensions
{
    public static bool ContainsMabster(this string s)
    {
        return s.Contains("Mabster");
    }
}
</CODE></PRE>
<P>So now every string has a tremendously useful ContainsMabster method, which I can use like this:</P><PRE><CODE>if ("Why hello there, Mabster!".ContainsMabster()) { /* ... */ }
</CODE></PRE>
<P>Note that you can also add extension methods to interfaces (eg IList), which means that any class implementing that interface will also pick up that new method.</P>
<P>Any extra parameters you declare in the extension method (after the first "this" parameter) are treated as normal parameters.</P>
<p>I can do an <code>eval("something()");</code> to execute the code dynamically in JavaScript. Is there a way for me to do the same thing in C#?</p>

<p>What I am exactly trying to do is that I have an integer variable (say <code>i</code>) and I have multiple properties by the names: "Property1", "Property2", "Property3", etc.
Now, I want to perform some operations on the " Property*i* " property depending on the value of <code>i</code>. </p>

<p>This is really simple with Javascript. Is there any way to do this with C#?</p>

<p>Example: I have two shared objects (same should apply to .dlls). The first shared object is from a third-party library, we'll call it libA.so. I have wrapped some of this with JNI and created my own library, libB.so. Now libB depends on libA.</p>

<p>When webstarting, both libraries are places in some webstart working area. My java code attempts to load libB. At this point the system loader will attempt to load libA which is not in the system library path (java.library.path won't help this). The end result is that libB has an unsatisfied link and cannot be used. </p>

<p>I have tried loading libA before libB, but that still does not work. Seems the OS wants to do that loading for me. Is there any way I can make this work other than statically  compiling?</p>
<p>Not really. You can use reflection to achieve what you want, but it won't be nearly as simple as in Javascript. For example, if you wanted to set the private field of an object to something, you could use this function:</p>

<pre><code>protected static void SetField(object o, string fieldName, object value)
{
   FieldInfo field = o.GetType().GetField(fieldName, BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic);
   field.SetValue(o, value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, C# isn't a dynamic language like that.</p>

<p>What you can do, however, is to create a C# source code file, full with class and everything, and run it through the CodeDom provider for C# and compile it into an assembly, and then execute it.</p>

<p>This forum post on MSDN contains an answer with some example code down the page somewhat:<br>
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/6a783cc4-bb54-4fec-b504-f9b1ed786b54/create-a-anonymous-method-from-a-string">create a anonymous method from a string? </a></p>

<p>I would hardly say this is a very good solution, but it is possible anyway.</p>

<p>What kind of code are you going to expect in that string? If it is a minor subset of valid code, for instance just math expressions, it might be that other alternatives exists.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Well, that teaches me to read the questions thoroughly first. Yes, reflection would be able to give you some help here.</p>

<p>If you split the string by the ; first, to get individual properties, you can use the following code to get a PropertyInfo object for a particular property for a class, and then use that object to manipulate a particular object.</p>

<pre><code>String propName = "Text";
PropertyInfo pi = someObject.GetType().GetProperty(propName);
pi.SetValue(someObject, "New Value", new Object[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>How do you create your own custom moniker (or URL Protocol) on Windows systems?</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>http:</li>
<li>mailto:</li>
<li>service:</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741006%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Creating and Using URL Monikers</a> , <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767916%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">About Asynchronous Pluggable Protocols</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767914.aspx" rel="nofollow">Registering an Application to a URL Protocol</a> from MSDN </p>
<p>All of that would definitely work.  Personally, for that particular problem, I would probably take a little different approach.  Maybe something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass {<br>  public Point point1, point2, point3;<br><br>  private Point[] points;<br><br>  public MyClass() {<br>    //...<br>    this.points = new Point[] {point1, point2, point3};<br>  }<br><br>  public void DoSomethingWith(int i) {<br>    Point target = this.points[i+1];<br>    // do stuff to target<br>  }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>When using patterns like this, you have to be careful that your data is stored by reference and not by value.  In other words, don't do this with primitives.  You have to use their big bloated class counterparts.</p>

<p>I realized that's not exactly the question, but the question has been pretty well answered and I thought maybe an alternative approach might help.</p>
<p>I've tried finding the ultimate compiler call earlier and I gave up. There's quite a number of layers of interfaces and virtual classes for my patience.</p>

<p>I don't think the source reader part of the compiler ends up with a DOM tree, but intuitively I would agree with you. The work necessary to transform the DOM to IL should be much less than reading C# source code.</p>

<p>Is there a C library function that will return the index of a character in a string?</p>

<p>So far, all I've found are functions like strstr that will return the found char *, not it's location in the original string.</p>
<p>If you are not totally tied to pure C and can use string.h there is strchr()
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstring/strchr.html" rel="nofollow">See here</a></p>
<p><code>strstr</code> returns a pointer to the found character, so you could use pointer arithmetic:  (Note: this code not tested for its ability to compile, it's one step away from pseudocode.)</p>

<pre><code>char * source = "test string";         /* assume source address is */
                                       /* 0x10 for example */
char * found = strstr( source, "in" ); /* should return 0x18 */
if (found != NULL)                     /* strstr returns NULL if item not found */
{
  int index = found - source;          /* index is 8 */
                                       /* source[8] gets you "i" */
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: strchr is better only for one char. 
Pointer aritmetics says "Hellow!":</p>

<pre><code>char *pos = strchr (myString, '#');
int pos = pos ? pos - myString : -1;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> strchr () returns NULL if no string is found</p>

<p>You can use strstr to accomplish what you want. Example:</p>

<pre><code>char *a = "Hello World!";<br>char *b = strstr(a, "World");<br><br>int position = b - a;<br><br>printf("the offset is %i\n", position);<br></code></pre>

<p>This produces the result:</p>

<pre><code>the offset is 6<br></code></pre>
<p>I think that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>size_t strcspn ( const char * str1, const char * str2 );</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is what you want. Here is an example pulled from <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstring/strcspn.html">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>/* strcspn example */

  i = strcspn (str,keys);

<p>I am new to C# and am doing some work in an existing application. I have a DirectX viewport that has components in it that I want to be able to position using arrow keys.</p>

<p>Currently I am overriding ProcessCmdKey and catching arrow input and send an OnKeyPress event. This works, but I want to be able to use modifiers(<strong><kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd></strong>). As soon as I am holding a modifier and press an arrow no events are triggered that I am listening to.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions on where I should go with this?</p>

<p>I need help finishing my custom built ajax [div] based dynamic dropdown. </p>

<p>Basically, I have an [input] box which; onkeyup, runs an Ajax search which returns a bunch of results in divs and are drawn back in using innerHTML. These divs all have highlights onmouseover so, a typical successfull search yields the following structure (pardon the semicode):</p>

<pre><code>[input]
 [div id=results] //this gets overwritten contantly by my AJAX function
  [div id=result1 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result1]
  [div id=result2 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result2]
  [div id=result2 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result2]
 [/div]
</code></pre>

<p>It works.. beautifully! looks elegant and is way more complete than any regular dropdown (those results div bring in a lot of information).</p>

<p>However, I'm missing the most of important functions behind regular HTML elements, that is, I can't keyboard down or up between "options". How do I do this? I know javascript handles keyboard events but; I haven't been able to find a good guide on how to do this. (Of course, the follow up question to this will eventually end up being: can I use <code>&lt;ENTER&gt;</code> to trigger that onclick event?)</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, I would think that you'd need to maintain some form of a data structure in the JavaScript that reflects the items in the current dropdown list. You'd also need a reference to the currently active/selected item. </p>

<p>Each time <code>keyup</code> or <code>keydown</code> is fired, update the reference to the active/selected item in the data structure. To provide highlighting information on the UI, add or remove a class name that is styled via CSS based on if the item is active/selected or not.</p>

<p>Also, this isn't a biggy, but <code>innerHTML</code> is not really standard (look into <code>createTextNode()</code>, <code>createElement()</code>, and <code>appendChild()</code> for standard ways of creating data). You may also want to see about attaching event handlers in the JavaScript rather than doing so in an HTML attribute.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can only run this once! You cannot install if the app name is in use - see other tasks like <strong>wsUninstallApp</strong></li>
<li>It probably won't start the app either</li>
<li>You need to run this on the server and the script is quite fragile</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alternatives</strong></p>

<p>I would probably use Java Management Extensions (JMX). You could write a file-upload servlet that accepts an EAR and uses the deployment MBeans to deploy the EAR on the server. You would just POST the file over HTTP. This would avoid any WAS API dependencies on your dev/build machine and could be independent of any one project.</p>

<p>Using VS2008, C#, .Net 2 and Winforms how can I make a regular Button look "pressed"?
Imagine this button is an on/off switch. 
ToolStripButton has the Checked property, but the regular Button does not.</p>
<p>I saw this in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4384/697449">an answer to another question</a>, in reference to shortcomings of the java spec:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are more shortcomings and this is a subtle topic. Check <a href="http://kiranthakkar.blogspot.com/2007/05/method-overloading-with-new-features-of.html">this</a> out:</p>

<pre><code>public class methodOverloading{
     public static void hello(Integer x){
          System.out.println("Integer");
     }

     public static void hello(long x){
          System.out.println("long");
     }

     public static void main(String[] args){
         int i = 5;
         hello(i);
     }
}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Here "long" would be printed (haven't checked it myself), because the compiler choses >widening over autoboxing. Be careful when using autoboxing or don't use it at all!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Are we sure that this is actually an example of widening instead of autoboxing, or is it something else entirely?</em></p>

<p>On my initial scanning, I would agree with the statement that the output would be "long" on the basis of <code>i</code> being declared as a primitive and not an object.  However, if you changed </p>

<pre><code>hello(long x)
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>hello(Long x)
</code></pre>

<p>the output would print "Integer"</p>

<p>What's really going on here?  I know nothing about the compilers/bytecode interpreters for java...</p>

<p>I'm using ColdFusion to populate a template that includes HTML lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>'s).</p>

<p>Most of these aren't that long, but a few have ridiculously long lengths and could really stand to be in 2-3 columns.</p>

<p>Is there an HTML, ColdFusion or perhaps JavaScript (I have jQuery available) way to do this easily?  It's not worth some over-complicated heavy weight solution to save some scrolling.</p>

<p>One method you can used to obtain this option is by placing a "CheckBox" object and changing its "Appearance" from "Normal" to "Button" this will give you the same functionality that I believe you are looking for.</p>
<p>There is no pure CSS/HTML way to achieve this, as far as I know.  Your best bet would be to do it in pre-processing (if list length > 150, split into 3 columns, esle if > 70, split into  2 columns, else 1).  </p>

<p>The other option, using JavaScript (I'm not familiar with the jQuery library specifically) would be to iterate through lists, probably based on them being a certain class, count the number of children, and if it is a high  enough number, dynamically create a new list after the first, transferring some number of list items to the new list.  As far as implementing the columns, you could probably float them left, followed by an element that had the style <code>clear:left</code> or <code>clear:both</code>.</p>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>ul.column {
    float:left;
    width:50%;
}
div.clear {
    clear:both;
}
</code></pre>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class="column"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 49&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="column"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 51&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 52&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 99&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="clear" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if this would be handled exactly the same way for webstart, but we ran into this situation in a desktop application when dealing with a set of native libraries (dlls in our case).</p>

<p>Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure </p>

<p>If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn't try to find a library that isn't in your path. It's klunky and a bit painful, but ensuring Java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work.</p>
<p>In the first case, you have a widening conversion happening. This can be see when runinng the "javap" utility program (included w/ the JDK), on the compiled class:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(java.lang.String[]);<br>  Code:<br>   0:   iconst_ 5<br>   1:   istore_ 1<br>   2:   iload_ 1<br>   3:   i2l<br>   4:   invokestatic    #6; //Method hello:(J)V<br>   7:   return<br><br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Clearly, you see the I2L, which is the mnemonic for the widening Integer-To-Long bytecode instruction. See reference <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/Instructions2.doc6.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>And in the other case, replacing the "long x" with the object "Long x" signature, you'll have this code in the main method:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(java.lang.String[]);<br>  Code:<br>   0:   iconst_ 5<br>   1:   istore_ 1<br>   2:   iload_ 1<br>   3:   invokestatic    #6; //Method java/lang/Integer.valueOf:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;<br>   6:   invokestatic    #7; //Method hello:(Ljava/lang/Integer;)V<br>   9:   return<br><br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>So you see the compiler has created the instruction Integer.valueOf(int), to box the primitive inside the wrapper.</p>
<p>I tried to follow a couple of googled up tutorials on setting up mod_python, but failed every time. Do you have a good, step-by step, rock-solid howto?</p>

<p>I'm working on a website which will switch to a new style on a set date. The site's built in semantic HTML and CSS, so the change should just require a CSS reference change. I'm working with a designer who will need to be able to see how it's looking, as well as a client who will need to be able to review content updates in the current look as well as design progress on the new look.</p>

<p>I'm planning to use a magic querystring value and / or a javascript link in the footer which writes out a cookie to select the new CSS page. We're working in ASP.NET 3.5. Any recommendations?</p>

<p>I should mention that we're using IE Conditional Comments for IE8,7,and 6 support. I may create a function that does a replacement:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;
&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;
    &lt;link type="text/css" href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;-ie8.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if lte IE 7]&gt;
    &lt;link type="text/css" href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;-ie7.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if lte IE 6]&gt;
    &lt;link type="text/css" href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;-ie6.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;

<P>In the .NET world, I recommend the HTML Agility Pack. Not near as simple as some of the above options (like HTMLSQL), but it's very flexible. It lets you maniuplate poorly formed HTML as if it were well formed XML, so you can use XPATH or just itereate over nodes.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack">http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack</A></P>
<p>There are two main ways of running Python on Apache. The simplest would be to use CGI and write normal Python scripts while the second is using a web framework like Django or Pylons.</p>

<p>Using CGI is straightforward. Make sure your Apache config file has a cgi-bin set up. If not, follow their documentation (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html" rel="nofollow">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html</a>). At that point all you need to do is place your Python scripts in the cgi-bin directory and the standard output will become the HTTP response. Refer to Python's documentation for further info (<a href="https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html</a>).</p>

<p>If you want to use a web framework you'll need to setup mod_python or FastCGI. These steps are dependent on which framework you want to use. Django provides clear instructions on how to setup mod_python and Django with Apache (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/" rel="nofollow">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/</a>)</p>

<p>I would suggest storing the stylesheet selection in the session so you don't have to rely on the querystring key being present all the time. You can check the session in Page_Load and add the appropriate stylesheet reference. It sounds like this is a temporary/development situation, so go with whatever is easy and works.</p>

<pre><code>if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.QueryString["css"]))<br>  Session.Add("CSS",Request.QueryString["css"]);<br></code></pre>
<p>So I dug up this article from A List Apart <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/multicolumnlists">CSS Swag: Multi-Column Lists</a>.  I ended up using the first solution, it's not the best but the others require either using complex HTML that can't be generated dynamically, or creating a lot of custom classes, which could be done but would require loads of in-line styling and possibly a huge page.</p>

<p>Other solutions are still welcome though.</p>
<P>In Asp.net 3.5, you should be able to set up the Link tag in the header as a server tag. Then in the codebehind you can set the href property for the link element, based on a cookie value, querystring, date, etc.</P>
<P>In your aspx file:</P><PRE><CODE>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;link id="linkStyles" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" runat="server" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</CODE></PRE>
<P>And in the Code behind:</P><PRE><CODE>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
  string stylesheetAddress = // logic to determine stylesheet
  linkStyles.Href = stylesheetAddress;
}
</CODE></PRE>
<p>You should look into ASP.NET themes, that's exactly what they're used for. They also allow you to skin controls, which means give them a set of default attributes.</p>
<p>I would do the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.website.com/?stylesheet=new.css" rel="nofollow">www.website.com/?stylesheet=new.css</a></p>

<p>Then in your ASP.NET code:</p>

<pre><code>if (Request.Querystring["stylesheet"] != null) {<br>    Response.Cookies["stylesheet"].Value = Request.QueryString["stylesheet"];<br>    Response.Redirect(&lt;Current Page&gt;);<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Then where you define your stylesheets:</p>

<pre><code>if (Request.Cookies["stylesheet"] != null) {<br>    // New Stylesheet<br>} else {<br>    // Default<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>Another interesting thing with this example is the method overloading. The combination of type widening and method overloading only working because the compiler has to make a decision of which method to choose. Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void hello(Collection x){
   System.out.println("Collection");
}

public static void hello(List x){
   System.out.println("List");
}

public static void main(String[] args){
   Collection col = new ArrayList();
   hello(col);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't use the run-time type which is List, it uses the compile-time type which is Collection and thus prints "Collection". </p>

<p>I encourage your to read <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=" rel="nofollow">Effective Java</a>, which opened my eyes to some corner cases of the JLS.</p>

<p>Yes, mod_python is pretty confusing to set up.  Here's how I did it.</p>

<p>In httpd.conf:</p>

<pre><code>LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so<br><br>&lt;Directory "/serverbase/htdocs/myapp"&gt;<br>  AddHandler mod_python .py<br>  PythonHandler myapp<br>  PythonDebug On<br></code></pre>

<p>and in your application directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ /serverbase/htdocs/myapp$ ls -l<br>total 16<br>-r-xr-xr-x 1 root sys        6484 May 21 15:54 myapp.py<br></code></pre>

<p>Repeat the configuration for each python program you wish to have running under mod_python.</p>
<p>Are you running Python on UNIX or Windows?</p>

<p>An alternative to mod_python and FastCGI is mod_wsgi. You can find out more at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/" rel="nofollow">modwsgi</a></p>

<p>I have built and installed this on Solaris without problems. I had previously tried mod_python but ran into problems with shared libraries as part of the build. There are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/InstallationInstructions" rel="nofollow">good install docs</a> available.</p>

<p>I am prototyping some C# 3 collection filters and came across this.
I have a collection of products:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyProduct
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Double Price { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}

var MyProducts = new  List&lt;MyProduct&gt;
{            
    new  MyProduct
    {
        Name = "Surfboard",
        Price = 144.99,
        Description = "Most important thing you will ever own."
    },
    new MyProduct
    {
        Name = "Leash",
        Price = 29.28,
        Description = "Keep important things close to you."
    }
    ,
    new MyProduct
    {
        Name = "Sun Screen",
        Price = 15.88,
        Description = "1000 SPF! Who Could ask for more?"
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I use LINQ to filter it works as expected:</p>

<pre><code>var d = (from mp in MyProducts
             where mp.Price &lt; 50d
             select mp);
</code></pre>

<p>And if I use the Where extension method combined with a Lambda the filter works as well:</p>

<pre><code>var f = MyProducts.Where(mp =&gt; mp.Price &lt; 50d).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the difference, and why use one over the other?</p>

<p>LINQ turns into method calls like the code you have.</p>

<p>In other words, there should be no difference.</p>

<p>However, in your two pieces of code you are not calling .ToList in the first, so the first piece of code will produce an enumerable data source, but if you call .ToList on it, the two should be the same.</p>
<p>What is the Java equivalent of PHP's <code>$_POST</code>? After searching the web for an hour, I'm still nowhere closer.</p>

<p>If I have a JavaScript associative array, say:</p>

<pre><code>var myArray = new Object();
myArray["firstname"] = "Gareth";
myArray["lastname"] = "Simpson";
myArray["age"] = 21;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a built-in or accepted best practice way to get the length of this array?</p>

<p>JavaScript does not have associative arrays -- it only has objects, <em>which can be used as a notion of associative arrays</em>.**</p>

<p>Your <code>HttpServletRequest</code> object has a <code>getParameter(String paramName)</code> method that can be used to get parameter values.  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getParameter(java.lang.String)">http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getParameter(java.lang.String)</a></p>

<p>I'm not a javascript expert but it looks like you would have to loop through the elements and count them since Object doesn't have a length method:</p>

<pre><code>var element_count = 0;
for (e in myArray) {  if (myArray.hasOwnProperty(e)) element_count++; }
</code></pre>

<p>@palmsey: In fairness to the OP, the javascript docs actually explicitly refer to using variables of type Object in this manner as "associative arrays".</p>

<p>In C#, (and feel free to answer for other languages), what order does the runtime evaluate a logic statement?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>DataTable myDt = new DataTable();
if (myDt != null &amp;&amp; myDt.Rows.Count &gt; 0)
{
    //do some stuff with myDt
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which statement does the runtime evaluate first - </p>

<pre><code>myDt != null
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>myDt.Rows.Count &gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>Is there a time when the compiler would ever evaluate the statement backwards? Perhaps when an "OR" operator is involved?</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>&amp; is known as a logical bitwise operator and will always evaluate all the sub-expressions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is a good example of when to use the bitwise operator instead of the "short-circuited boolean"?</p>

<p>C# : Left to right, and processing stops if a non-match (evaluates to false) is found.</p>

<p>I have heard somewhere that compilers work backwards, but I am unsure how true this is.</p>
<p><strong>vb.net</strong></p>

<pre><code>if( x isNot Nothing AndAlso x.go()) then<br></code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Evaluation is done left to right</li>
<li><strong>AndAlso</strong> operator makes sure that only if the left side was TRUE, the right side will be evaluated (very important, since ifx is nothing x.go will crash)</li>
</ol>

<p>You may use <strong>And</strong> instead ofAndAlso in vb. in which case the left side gets evaluated first as well, but the right side will get evaluated regardless of result. </p>

<p>Best Practice: Always use AndAlso, unless you have a very good reason why not to.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>It was asked in a followup why or when would anyone use And instead of AndAlso (or &amp; instead of &amp;&amp;):</strong>
Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>if ( x.init() And y.init()) then<br>   x.process(y)<br>end <br>y.doDance()<br></code></pre>

<p>In this case, I want to init both X and Y. Y must be initialized in order for y.DoDance to be able to execute. However, in the init() function I am doing also some extra thing like checking a socket is open, and only if that works out ok, for <strong>both</strong>, I should go ahead and do the x.process(y).</p>

<p>Again, this is probably not needed and not elegant in 99% of the cases, that is why I said that the default should be to use <em>AndAlso</em>.</p>
<P>The concept modesty is referring to is operator overloading. in the statement:</P><PRE><CODE>if( A &amp;&amp; B){
    // do something
}
</CODE></PRE>
<P>A is evaluated first, if it evaluates to false, B is never evaluated. The same applies to</P><PRE><CODE>if(A || B){
    //do something
}
</CODE></PRE>
<P>A is evaluated first, if it evaluates to true, B is never evaluated.</P>
<P>This concept, overloading, applies to (i think) all of the C style languages, and many others as well.</P>
<p>ZombieSheep is dead-on.  The only "gotcha" that might be waiting is that this is only true if you are using the &amp;&amp; operator.  When using the &amp; operator, both expressions will be evaluated every time, regardless if one or both evaluate to false.</p>

<pre><code>if (amHungry &amp; whiteCastleIsNearby)<br>{<br>   // The code will check if White Castle is nearby<br>   // even when I am not hungry<br>}<br><br>if (amHungry &amp;&amp; whiteCastleIsNearby)<br>{<br>   // The code will only check if White Castle is nearby<br>   // when I am hungry<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>Some languages have interesting situations where expressions are executed in a different order.  I am specifically thinking of Ruby, but I'm sure they borrowed it from elsewhere (probably Perl).</p>

<p>The expressions in the logic will stay left to right, but for example:</p>

<pre><code>puts message unless message.nil?<br></code></pre>

<p>The above will evaluate "message.nil?" first, then if it evaluates to false (unless is like if except it executes when the condition is false instead of true), "puts message" will execute, which prints the contents of the message variable to the screen.</p>

<p>It's kind of an interesting way to structure your code sometimes... I personally like to use it for very short 1 liners like the above.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>To make it a little clearer, the above is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>unless message.nil?<br>  puts message<br>end<br></code></pre>
<p>Nopes, at least the C# compiler doesn't work backwards (in either &amp;&amp; or ||). It's left to right.</p>
<P>You need to set the run-time library (Under C/C++ -&gt; Code Generation) for ALL projects to static linkage, which correlates to the following default building configurations:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Multithreaded Debug/Release</LI>
<LI>Singlethreaded Debug/Release</LI></UL>
<P>As opposed to the "DLL" versions of those libraries.</P>
<P>Even if you do that, depending on the libraries you're using, you might have to install a Merge Module/framework/etc. It depends on whether static LIB versions of your dependencies are available.</P>

  <p>What is a good example of when to use the bitwise operator instead of the "short-circuited boolean"?</p>

<p>Suppose you have flags, say for file attributes. Suppose you've defined READ as 4, WRITE as 2, and EXEC as 1. In binary, that's:</p>

<pre><code>READ  0100  <br>WRITE 0010  <br>EXEC  0001<br></code></pre>

<p>Each flag has one bit set, and each one is unique. The bitwise operators let you combine these flags:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The concept modesty is referring to is operator overloading. in the statement:
  ...
  A is evaluated first, if it evaluates to false, B is never evaluated. The same applies to</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not operator overloading. Operator overloading is the term given for letting you define custom behaviour for operators, such as *, +, = and so on.</p>

<p>This would let you write your own 'Log' class, and then do </p>

<pre><code>a = new Log(); // Log class overloads the + operator<br>a + "some string"; // Call the overloaded method - otherwise this wouldn't work because you can't normally add strings to objects.<br></code></pre>

<pre><code>a() || b() // be never runs if a is true<br></code></pre>

<p>is actually called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation">Short Circuit Evaluation</a></p>
<p>You use &amp; when you specifically want to evaluate all the sub-expressions, most likely because they have side-effects you want, even though the final result will be <em>false</em> and thus not execute your <em>then</em> part of your <em>if</em>-statement.</p>

<p>Note that &amp; and | operates for both bitwise masks and boolean values and is not just for bitwise operations. They're <em>called</em> bitwise, but they are defined for both integers and boolean data types in C#.</p>
<p>When things are all in-line, they're executed left-to-right.</p>

<p>When things are nested, they're executed inner-to-outer. This may seem confusing as usually what's "innermost" is on the right-hand side of the line, so it seems like it's going backwards...</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre><code>a = Foo( 5, GetSummary( "Orion", GetAddress("Orion") ) );<br></code></pre>

<p>Things happen like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call <code>GetAddress</code> with the literal <code>"Orion"</code></li>
<li>Call <code>GetSummary</code> with the literal <code>"Orion"</code> and the result of <code>GetAddress</code></li>
<li>Call <code>Foo</code> with the literal <code>5</code> and the result of <code>GetSummary</code></li>
<li>Assign this value to <code>a</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I realise this question has already been answered, but I'd like to throw in another bit of information which is related to the topic.</p>

<p>In languages, like C++, where you can actually overload the behaviour of the &amp;&amp; and || operators, it is highly recommended that you <strong>do not do this</strong>. This is because when you overload this behaviour, you end up forcing the evaluation of both sides of the operation. This does two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>It breaks the lazy evaluation mechanism because the overload is a function which has to be invoked, and hence both parameters are evaluated before calling the function.</li>
<li>The order of evaluation of said parameters isn't guaranteed and can be compiler specific. Hence the objects wouldn't behave in the same manner as they do in the examples listed in the question/previous answers.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more info, have a read of Scott Meyers' book, <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/020163371X" rel="nofollow">More Effective C++</a>. Cheers!</p>
<p>I have a binary file that I have to parse and I'm using Python. Is there a way to take 4 bytes and convert it to a single precision floating point number?</p>
<p>I like Orion's responses. I'll add two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The left-to-right still applies first</li>
<li>The inner-to-outer to ensure that all arguments are resolved before calling the function</li>
</ol>

<p>Say we have the following example:</p>

<pre><code>a = Foo(5, GetSummary("Orion", GetAddress("Orion")),<br>           GetSummary("Chris", GetAddress("Chris")));<br></code></pre>

<p>Here's the order of execution:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>GetAddress("Orion")</code></li>
<li><code>GetSummary("Orion", ...)</code></li>
<li><code>GetAddress("Chris")</code></li>
<li><code>GetSummary("Chris", ...)</code></li>
<li><code>Foo(...)</code></li>
<li>Assigns to <code>a</code></li>
</ol>

<p>I can't speak about C#'s legal requirements (although I did test a similar example using Mono before writing this post), but this order is guaranteed in Java.</p>

<p>And just for completeness (since this is a language-agnostic thread as well), there are languages like C and C++, where the order is not guaranteed unless there is a sequence point. References: <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/056.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/misc-technical-issues.html#faq-39.16" rel="nofollow">2</a>. In answering the thread's question, however, <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> are sequence points in C++ (unless overloaded; also see OJ's excellent answer). So some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>foo() &amp;&amp; bar()</code></li>
<li><code>foo() &amp; bar()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> case, <code>foo()</code> is guaranteed to run before <code>bar()</code> (if the latter is run at all), since <code>&amp;&amp;</code> is a sequence point. In the <code>&amp;</code> case, no such guarantee is made (in C and C++), and indeed <code>bar()</code> can run before <code>foo()</code>, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Does it make sense, having all of the C#-managed-bliss, to go back to Petzold's Programming Windows and try to produce code w/ pure WinAPI?</p>

<p>What can be learn from it? Isn't it just too outdated to be useful?</p>

<p>Absolutely.  When nobody knows the low level, who will update and write the high level languages?  Also, when you understand the low level stuff, you can write more efficient code in a higher level language, and also debug more efficiently.</p>

<P>The native APIs are the "real" operating system APIs. The .NET library is (with few exceptions) nothing more than a fancy wrapper around them. So yes, I'd say that anybody who can understand .NET with all its complexity, can understand relatively mundane things like talking to the API without the benefit of a middle-man.</P>
<P>Just try to do DLL Injection from managed code. It can't be done. You will be forced to write native code for this, for windowing tweaks, for real subclassing, and a dozen other things.</P>
<P>So yes: you should (must) know both.</P>
<P>Edit: even if you plan to use P/Invoke.</P>
<p>This question is bordering on religious :) But I'll give my thoughts anyway.</p>

<p>I do see value in learing the Win32 API. Most, if not all, GUI libraries (managed or unmanaged) result in calls to the Win32 API. Even the most thorough libraries don't cover 100% of the API, and hence there are always gaps which need to be plugged by direct API calls or P/invoking. Some of the names of the wrappers around the API calls have similar names to the underlying API calls, but those names aren't exactly self-documenting. So understanding the underlying API, and the terminology used therein, will aid in understanding the wrapper APIs and what they actually do.</p>

<p>Plus, if you understand the nature of the underlying APIs that are used by frameworks, then you will make better choices with regards to which library functionality you should use in a given scenario.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Analogy: If you build cars for a living (programming), then its very pertinent to know how the engine works (Win32).</p>
<p>I just saw a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5516/what-happened-to-all-of-the-java-developers-how-can-i-get-started-in-net#5522" rel="nofollow">comment of suggesting J#</a>, and it made me wonder... is there a real, beneficial use of J# over Java?  So, my feeling is that the only reason you would even consider using J# is that management has decreed that the company should jump on the Java bandwagon... and the .NET bandwagon.  If you use J#, you are effectively losing the biggest benefit of picking Java... rich cross platform support.  Sure there is Mono, but it's not as richly supported or as full featured right?  I remember hearing Forms are not fully (perhaps at all) supported.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to bash .NET here, I'm just saying, if you are going to go the Microsoft route, why not just use C#?  If you are going to go the Java route, why would J# enter the picture?</p>

<p>I'm hoping to find some real world cases here, so please especially respond if you've ACTUALLY used J# in a REAL project, and why.</p>
<p>Simple answer, YES.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of J# is to ease the transition of Java developers to the .NET environment which didn't work so well (I guessing here) so Microsoft dropped J# from Visual Studio 2008.
For your question, "Is there a real benefit of using J#?"..
in a nutshell... No..</p>
<p>One of the killers I've found with J# in the past is that there is no built in support for referencing web services. That alone has been enough to deter me from it ever since.</p>
<p>Learning a new programming language or technology is for one of three reasons:<br>
1. Need: you're starting a project for building a web application and you don't know anything about ASP.NET<br>
2. Enthusiasm: you're very excited about ASP.NET MVC. why not try that?<br>
3. Free time: but who has that anyway.</p>

<p>The best reason to learn something new is Need. If you need to do something that the .NET framework can't do (like performance for example) then WinAPI is your solution. Until then we keep ourself busy with learning about .NET</p>
<p>C# syntax is so close to Java (and better in some ways) that you might as well learn C# instead of J#.  And since C# is more widely used, you can easily find Java --&gt; C# tutorials on google or check out <a href="http://www.asp.net/learn" rel="nofollow">http://www.asp.net/learn</a> and watch some videos.</p>

<p>Does anyone have, or know of, a binary patch generation algorithm implementation in C#?</p>

<p>Basically, compare two files (designated <em>old</em> and <em>new</em>), and produce a patch file that can be used to upgrade the <em>old</em> file to have the same contents as the <em>new</em> file.</p>

<p>The implementation would have to be relatively fast, and work with huge files. It should exhibit O(n) or O(logn) runtimes.</p>

<p>My own algorithms tend to either be lousy (fast but produce huge patches) or slow (produce small patches but have O(n^2) runtime).</p>

<p>Any advice, or pointers for implementation would be nice.</p>

<p>Specifically, the implementation will be used to keep servers in sync for various large datafiles that we have one master server for. When the master server datafiles change, we need to update several off-site servers as well.</p>

<p>The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab the first four bytes from the <em>old</em> file, call this the <em>key</em></li>
<li>Add those bytes to a dictionary, where <em>key -> position</em>, where <em>position</em> is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with</li>
<li>Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the <em>old</em> file</li>
<li>From the start of the <em>new</em> file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary</li>
<li>If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files</li>
<li>Encode a reference to that location in the <em>old</em> file, and skip the matched block in the <em>new</em> file</li>
<li>If not found, encode 1 byte from the <em>new</em> file, and skip it</li>
<li>Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the <em>new</em> file</li>
</ol>

<p>This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal.</p>

<p>A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files.</p>

<p>There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: Here is a more detailed description of the above algorithm.</p>

<p>First, combine the two files, so that you have one big file. Remember the cut-point between the two files.</p>

<p>Secondly, do that <em>grab 4 bytes and add their position to the dictionary</em> step for everything in the whole file.</p>

<p>Thirdly, from where the <em>new</em> file starts, do the loop with attempting to locate an existing combination of 4 bytes, and find the longest match. Make sure we only consider positions from the old file, or from <em>earlier in the new file than we're currently at</em>. This ensures that we can reuse material in both the old and the new file during patch application.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit #2</strong>: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lvknet/source/browse/trunk/LVK/IO/Patching/Binary/BinaryPatch.cs">Source code to the above algorithm</a></p>

<p>You might get a warning about the certificate having some problems. I don't know how to resolve that so for the time being just accept the certificate.</p>

<p>The source uses lots of other types from the rest of my library so that file isn't all it takes, but that's the algorithm implementation.</p>

<hr>

<p>@lomaxx, I have tried to find a good documentation for the algorithm used in subversion, called xdelta, but unless you already know how the algorithm works, the documents I've found fail to tell me what I need to know.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I'm just dense... :)</p>

<p>I took a quick peek on the algorithm from that site you gave, and it is unfortunately not usable. A comment from the binary diff file says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finding an optimal set of differences requires quadratic time relative to the input size, so it becomes unusable very quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My needs aren't optimal though, so I'm looking for a more practical solution.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer though, added a bookmark to his utilities if I ever need them.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: Note, I will look at his code to see if I can find some ideas, and I'll also send him an email later with questions, but I've read that book he references and though the solution is good for finding optimal solutions, it is impractical in use due to the time requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #2</strong>: I'll definitely hunt down the python xdelta implementation.</p>

<p>I'm just getting into creating some WCF services, but I have a requirement to make them backward compatible for legacy (.NET 1.1 and 2.0) client applications.  </p>

<p>I've managed to get the services to run correctly for 3.0 and greater clients, but when I publish the services using a basicHttpBinding endpoint (which I believe is required for the compatibility I need), the service refactors my method signatures.  e.g.</p>

<pre><code>public bool MethodToReturnTrue(string seedValue);
</code></pre>

<p>appears to the client apps as</p>

<pre><code>public void MethodToReturnTrue(string seedValue, out bool result, out bool MethodToReturnTrueResultSpecified);
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried every configuration parameter I can think of in the app.config for my self-hosting console app, but I can't seem to make this function as expected.  I suppose this might lead to the fact that my expectations are flawed, but I'd be surprised that a WCF service is incapable of handling a bool return type to a down-level client.</p>

<p>My current app.config looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;  
  &lt;system.serviceModel&gt;
    &lt;services&gt;
      &lt;service behaviorConfiguration="MyServiceTypeBehaviors" Name="MyCompany.Services.CentreService.CentreService"&gt;

        &lt;endpoint address="http://localhost:8080/CentreService" binding="basicHttpBinding" bindingName="Compatible" name="basicEndpoint" contract="MyCompany.Services.CentreService.ICentreService" /&gt;
      &lt;/service&gt;
    &lt;/services&gt;

<p>I've opened an old workspace that is a libray and its test harness. It used to work fine but now doesn't and older versions of the code don't work either with the same errors. I've tried recreating the project and that causes the same errors too. Nothing seems out of order in project settings and the code generated works in the main app.</p>

<p>I've stripped out most of the files and got it down to the bare minimum to generate the error. Unfortunately I can't post the project as this is used in production code.</p>

<p>The LNK2001 linker error I get usually means I've left off a library or forgot to implement a virtual function. However this is part of the standard template library - and is a header at that.</p>

<p>The code that is listed as having the problem in IOCompletionPort.obj doesn't actually use <code>std::string</code> directly, but does call a class that does: <code>Comms::Exception</code> accepts a <code>std::string</code> and the value of <code>GetLastError</code> or <code>WSAGetLastError</code>.</p>

<p>The function mentioned in the error (<code>GetMessage</code>) is implemented, but is a virtual function so other classes can override it if need be. However it appears that the compiler has made it as an Ansi version, but I can't find any options in the settings that would control that. I suspect that might be the problem but since there's very little in the way of options for the library I have no way of knowing for sure. However both projects to specify _MBCS in the compiler options.</p>

<p>Any suggestions? I've lost most of the morning to this and don't want to lose most of the afternoon too.</p>

<p>I've been tasked (by my wife) with creating a program to allow her to track the family trees on both sides of our family.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a cost effective (free) control to represent this type of information.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is a modified org-chart type chart/tree.  The modification is that any node should have 2 parent nodes (E.G. a child should have a Mother/Father).</p>

<p>The solution I've came up with so far is to have 2 trees, an ancestor tree and a descendants tree, with the individual being inspected as the root node for each tree.  It works, but is sort of clunky.</p>

<p>I'm working primarily in c# WinForms, so .Net type controls or source code is preferrable.</p>

<p>One possibility lies with Win32 ANSI/Unicode "name-mangling", which turns the symbol <code>GetMessage</code> into either <code>GetMessageA</code> or <code>GetMessageW</code>. There are three possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Windows.h hasn't been loaded, so <code>GetMessage</code> stays <code>GetMessage</code></p></li>
<li><p>Windows.h was loaded with symbols set for ANSI, so <code>GetMessage</code> becomes <code>GetMessageA</code> </p></li>
<li><p>Windows.h was loaded with symbols set for Unicode, so <code>GetMessage</code> becomes <code>GetMessageW</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you've compiled two different files in ways that trigger two different scenarios, you'll get a linker error.  The error message indicates that the <code>Comms::Exception</code> class was an instance of #2, above -- perhaps it's used somewhere that windows.h hasn't been loaded?</p>

<p>Other things I'd do in your place, just as a matter of routine:</p>

<p>1) Ensure that my include and library paths don't contain anything that I'm not expecting.</p>

<p>2) Do a "build clean" and then manually verify it, deleting any extra object files if necessary.</p>

<p>3) Make sure there aren't any hardcoded paths in include statements that don't mean what they meant when the project was originally rebuilt.</p>

<p>@Jon: thank for your quick answer. It works, but the filesize on the web server is slightly less than the filesize of the downloaded file. </p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>Local Size  Server Size
 2.223.533  2.115.516
   664.603    662.121
</code></pre>

<p>It has anything to do with the CR/LF conversion?</p>

<p>This gets the value of whatever is selected in my dropdown menu.</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('newSkill').value
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot however find out what property to go after for the text that's currently displayed by the drop down menu. I tried "text" then looked at <a href="http://w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> but that didn't have the answer, does anybody here know?</p>

<p>For those not sure, here's the HTML for a drop down box.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name="newSkill" id="newSkill"&gt;
    &lt;option value="1"&gt;A skill&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="2"&gt;Another skill&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="3"&gt;Yet another skill&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

<p>Yahoo has separate map for India ( which has more details than the regular maps.yahoo.com) at http://in.maps.yahoo.com/ . But when I use the API it goes to default map. How do I get API access to YMaps India? </p>
<p>Does this get the correct answer? </p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById("newSkill").innerHTML

<p>The size of the file is sent as the Content-Length header. Here is how to get it with urllib:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; site = urllib.urlopen("http://python.org")<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; meta = site.info()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print meta.getheaders("Content-Length")<br>['16535']<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br></code></pre>
<p>Using the returned-urllib-object method <code>info()</code>, you can get various information on the retrived document. Example of grabbing the current Google logo:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = urllib.urlopen("http://www.google.co.uk/logos/olympics08_opening.gif")<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print d.info()<br><br>Content-Type: image/gif<br>Last-Modified: Thu, 07 Aug 2008 16:20:19 GMT  <br>Expires: Sun, 17 Jan 2038 19:14:07 GMT <br>Cache-Control: public <br>Date: Fri, 08 Aug 2008 13:40:41 GMT <br>Server: gws <br>Content-Length: 20172 <br>Connection: Close<br></code></pre>

<p>It's a dict, so to get the size of the file, you do <code>urllibobject.info()['Content-Length']</code></p>

<pre><code>print f.info()['Content-Length']<br></code></pre>

<p>And to get the size of the local file (for comparison), you can use the os.stat() command:</p>

<pre><code>os.stat("/the/local/file.zip").st_size<br></code></pre>
<p>Also if the server you are connecting to supports it, look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag" rel="nofollow">Etags</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_headers#Requests" rel="nofollow">If-Modified-Since</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_headers#Requests" rel="nofollow">If-None-Match</a> headers.</p>

<p>Using these will take advantage of the webserver's caching rules and will return a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection" rel="nofollow">304 Not Modified</a> status code if the content hasn't changed.</p>
<p>This should return the text value of the selected value</p>

<pre><code>var vSkill = document.getElementById('newSkill');

var vSkillText = vSkill.options[vSkill.selectedIndex].innerHTML;

alert(vSkillText);
</code></pre>

<p>Props: @Tanerax for reading the question, knowing what was asked and answering it before others figured it out.</p>

<p>Edit: DownModed, cause I actually read a question fully, and answered it, sad world it is.</p>
<p>windows.h is declared at the top of IOCompletionPort.h as an include - I was sick of seeing 7 lines just to include 1 file so I have wrapped it its own file and includes that itself. This also contains some additional #defines (ie ULONG_PTR) as our main app won't compile with the Platform SDK installed:-(</p>

<ol>
<li>That is confirmed. Nothing is out of place.</li>
<li>I've done that - deleted the build directories</li>
<li>I never use hard-coded paths.</li>
</ol>

<p>Presuming you haven't futzed around with the Project settings deleting something you ought not have (which is where I'd expect external dependencies like User32.lib to be):</p>

<p>Check Tools | Options | Directories | Libraries (going from memory here) and ensure that you're not missing the common-all-garden variety lib directories (again, without VC6 in front of me, I can't tell you what they are)</p>
<p>Based on your example HTML code, here's one way to get the displayed text of the currently selected option:</p>

<pre><code>var skillsSelect = document.getElementById("newSkill");
var selectedText = skillsSelect.options[skillsSelect.selectedIndex].text;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the context menu to be dependent on the selected item you're best move I think is to use Jonesinator's code to select the clicked item. Your context menu content can then be dependent on the selected item.</p>

<p>Selecting the item first as opposed to just using it for the context menu gives a few advantages. The first is that the user has a visual indication as to which he clicked and thus which item the menu is associated with. The second is that this way it's a hell of a lot easier to keep compatible with other methods of invoking the context menu (e.g. keyboard shortcuts).</p>
<p>I have reproduced what you are seeing:</p>

<pre><code>import urllib, os<br>link = "http://python.org"<br>print "opening url:", link<br>site = urllib.urlopen(link)<br>meta = site.info()<br>print "Content-Length:", meta.getheaders("Content-Length")[0]<br><br>f = open("out.txt", "r")<br>print "File on disk:",len(f.read())<br>f.close()<br><br><br>f = open("out.txt", "w")<br>f.write(site.read())<br>site.close()<br>f.close()<br><br>f = open("out.txt", "r")<br>print "File on disk after download:",len(f.read())<br>f.close()<br><br>print "os.stat().st_size returns:", os.stat("out.txt").st_size<br></code></pre>

<p>Outputs this:</p>

<pre><code>opening url: http://python.org<br>Content-Length: 16535<br>File on disk: 16535<br>File on disk after download: 16535<br>os.stat().st_size returns: 16861<br></code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong here? Is os.stat().st_size not returning the correct size?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:
OK, I figured out what the problem was:</p>

<pre><code>import urllib, os<br>link = "http://python.org"<br>print "opening url:", link<br>site = urllib.urlopen(link)<br>meta = site.info()<br>print "Content-Length:", meta.getheaders("Content-Length")[0]<br><br>f = open("out.txt", "rb")<br>print "File on disk:",len(f.read())<br>f.close()<br><br><br>f = open("out.txt", "wb")<br>f.write(site.read())<br>site.close()<br>f.close()<br><br>f = open("out.txt", "rb")<br>print "File on disk after download:",len(f.read())<br>f.close()<br><br>print "os.stat().st_size returns:", os.stat("out.txt").st_size<br></code></pre>

<p>this outputs:</p>

<pre><code>$ python test.py<br>opening url: http://python.org<br>Content-Length: 16535<br>File on disk: 16535<br>File on disk after download: 16535<br>os.stat().st_size returns: 16535<br></code></pre>

<p>Make sure you are opening both files for binary read/write.</p>

<p>For most needs on the desktop you wont need to know the Win32, however there is a LOT of Win32 not in .NET, but it is in the outlaying stuff that may end up being less than 1% of your application.</p>

<p>USB support, HID support, Windows Media Foundation just off the top of my head. There are many cool Vista API's only available from Win32.</p>

<p>You will do yourself a large favor by learning how to do interop with a Win32 API, if you do desktop programing, because when you do need to call Win32, and you will, you won't spend weeks scratching your head.</p>
<p>Protocol buffers are intended to optimize communications between machines. They are really not intended for human interaction. Also, the format is binary, so it could not replace XML in that use case. </p>

<p>I would also recommend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> as being the most compact text-based format.</p>
<p>When you subscribe to an event on an object from within a form, you are essentially handing over control of your callback method to the event source. You have no idea whether that event source will choose to trigger the event on a different thread.</p>

<p>The problem is that when the callback is invoked, you cannot assume that you can make update controls on your form because sometimes those controls will throw an expection if the event callback was called on a thread different than the thread the form was run on.</p>
<p>Here are the salient points:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can't make UI control calls from a different thread than the one they were created on (the form's thread).</li>
<li>Delegate invocations (ie, event hooks) are triggered on the same thread as the object that is firing the event. </li>
</ol>

<p>So, if you have a separate "engine" thread doing some work and have some UI watching for state changes which can be reflected in the UI (such as a progress bar or whatever), you have a problem. The engine fire's an object changed event which has been hooked by the Form. But the callback delegate that the Form registered with the engine gets called on the engine's thread not on the Form's thread. And so you can't update any controls from that callback. Doh!</p>

<p><strong>BeginInvoke</strong> comes to the rescue. Just use this simple coding model in all your callback methods and you can be sure that things are going to be okay:</p>

<pre><code>private delegate void EventArgsDelegate(object sender, EventArgs ea);<br><br>void SomethingHappened(object sender, EventArgs ea)<br>{<br>   //<br>   // Make sure this callback is on the correct thread<br>   //<br>   if (this.InvokeRequired)<br>   {<br>      this.Invoke(new EventArgsDelegate(SomethingHappened), new object[] { sender, ea });<br>      return;<br>   }<br><br>   //<br>   // Do something with the event such as update a control<br>   //<br>   textBox1.Text = "Something happened";<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>It's quite simple really.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use <strong>InvokeRequired</strong> to find out if this callback happened on the correct thread.</li>
<li>If not, then reinvoke the callback on the correct thread with the same parameters. You can reinvoke a method by using the <strong>Invoke</strong> (blocking) or <strong>BeginInvoke</strong> (non-blocking) methods.</li>
<li>The next time the function is called, <strong>InvokeRequired</strong> returns false because we are now on the correct thread and everybody is happy. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is a very compact way of addressing this problem and making your Forms safe from multi-threaded event callbacks.</p>
<p>In many simple cases, you can use the MethodInvoker delegate and avoid the need to create your own delegate type.</p>
<p>Here's how and don't forget to check that the property is not on the prototype chain:</p>

<pre><code>var element_count = 0;
for(var e in myArray)
    if(myArray.hasOwnProperty(e))
        element_count++;
</code></pre>

<p>Why is <code>Array.Length</code> an int, and not an <code>uint</code>. This bothers me (just a bit), because a length value can never by negative. </p>

<p>This also forced me to use an int for a length-property on my own class, because when you 
specify an int-value, this needs to be cast explicitly...</p>

<p>So the ultimate question is: is there any use for an unsigned int (<code>uint</code>)? Even Microsoft seems not to use them.</p>

<p>Typically, integer values are signed, unless you explicitly need an unsigned value. It's just the way they are used. I may not agree with that choice, but that's just the way it is.</p>

<p>For the time being, with todays typical memory constraints, if your array or similar data structure needs an UInt32 length, you should consider other data structures.</p>

<p>With an array of bytes, Int32 will give you 2GB of values</p>
<p>Why are unsigned integers not CLS compliant?</p>

<p>I am starting to think the type specification is just for performance and not for correctness.</p>

<p>Unsigned integers are not CLS compliant because they're not interoperable between certain languages.</p>
<p>I think it also might have to do with simplifying things on a lower level, since Array.Length will of course be added to a negative number at some point, if Array.Length were unsigned, and added to a negative int (two's complement), there could be messy results.</p>
<p>From Java the <strike><a href="http://www.rxtx.org/" rel="nofollow">rxtx</a></strike> (<strong>NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE</strong>)library is quite good. It picks up where Sun's serial IO framework left off. </p>

<p>I tend to follow the design of JDK libraries, especially Collections and Concurrency (Joshua Bloch, Doug Lea, those guys know how to design solid APIs). Anyway, many APIs in the JDK pro-actively throws <code>NullPointerException</code>. </p>

<p>For example, the Javadoc for <code>Map.containsKey</code> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@throws NullPointerException if the key is null and this map
    does not permit null keys (optional).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's perfectly valid to throw your own NPE. The convention is to include the parameter name which was null in the message of the exception. </p>

<p>The pattern goes:</p>

<pre><code>public void someMethod(Object mustNotBeNull) {  
    if (mustNotBeNull == null) {  
        throw new NullPointerException("mustNotBeNull must not be null");  
    }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whatever you do, don't allow a bad value to get set and throw an exception later when other code attempts to use it. That makes debugging a nightmare. You should always the follow the "fail-fast" principle.</p>

<p>I am running a Tomcat application, and I need to display some time values.  Unfortunately, the time is coming up an hour off.  I looked into it and discovered that my default TimeZone is being set to:</p>

<pre><code>sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id="GMT-08:00",
                           offset=-28800000,
                           dstSavings=0,
                           useDaylight=false,
                           transitions=0,
                           lastRule=null]
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than the Pacific time zone.  This is further indicated when I try to print the default time zone's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getDisplayName()" rel="nofollow">display name</a>, and it comes up "GMT-08:00", which seems to indicate to me that it is not correctly set to the US Pacific time zone.  I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon.</p>

<p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include "-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>

<p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?  I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>

<p>Hmm... off by one hour. DST possibly?</p>

<p>Is the date set correctly? 
What version of the JDK is this running on? ("java -version")</p>
<p>Is it possible to access an element on a Master page from the page loaded within the <code>ContentPlaceHolder</code> for the master?</p>

<p>I have a ListView that lists people's names in a navigation area on the Master page. I would like to update the ListView after a person has been added to the table that the ListView is data bound to. The <code>ListView</code> currently does not update it's values until the cache is reloaded. We have found that just re-running the <code>ListView.DataBind()</code> will update a listview's contents. We have not been able to run the <code>ListView.DataBind()</code> on a page that uses the Master page. </p>

<p>Below is a sample of what I wanted to do but a compiler error says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"PeopleListView does not exist in the current context"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GIS.master - Where ListView resides</p>

<pre><code>...&lt;asp:ListView ID="PeopleListView"...
</code></pre>

<p>GISInput_People.aspx - Uses GIS.master as it's master page</p>

<p>GISInput_People.aspx.cs</p>

<pre><code>AddNewPerson()
{
    // Add person to table
    ....

    // Update Person List
    PeopleListView.DataBind();
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>What would be the best way to resolve an issue like this in C# .Net?</p>

<p>Assuming your master page was named MyMaster:</p>

<pre><code>(Master as MyMaster).PeopleListView.DataBind();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> since PeopleListView will be declared protected by default, you will either need to change this to public, or create a public property wrapper so that you can access it from your page.</p>
<p>I believe you <em>could</em> do this by using this.Master.FindControl or something similar, but you probably shouldn't - it requires the content page to know too much about the structure of the master page.</p>

<p>I would suggest another method, such as firing an event in the content area that the master could listen for and re-bind when fired.</p>
<p>Assuming the control is called "PeopleListView" on the master page</p>

<pre><code>ListView peopleListView = (ListView)this.Master.FindControl("PeopleListView");
peopleListView.DataSource = [whatever];
peopleListView.DataBind();
</code></pre>

<p>But @<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/521/palmsey">palmsey</a> is more correct, especially if your page could have the possibility of more than one master page. Decouple them and use an event.</p>

<p>In a C# (feel free to answer for other languages) loop, what's the difference between break and continue as a means to leave the structure of the loop, and go to the next iteration?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (DataRow row in myTable.Rows)<br>{<br>    if (someConditionEvalsToTrue)<br>    {<br>        break; //what's the difference between this and continue ?<br>        //continue;<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>break would stop the foreach loop completely, continue would skip to the next DataRow</p>
<p><code>break</code> will exit the loop completely, <code>continue</code> will just <strong>skip</strong> the current iteration.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    if (i == 0) {
        break;
    }

    DoSomeThingWith(i);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The break will cause the loop to exit on the first iteration - <code>DoSomeThingWith</code> will never be executed. This here:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    if(i == 0) {
        continue;
    }

    DoSomeThingWith(i);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Will not execute <code>DoSomeThingWith</code> for <code>i = 0</code>, but the loop will <strong>continue</strong> and <code>DoSomeThingWith</code> will be executed for <code>i = 1</code> to <code>i = 9</code>.</p>

<p>I'm creating a web application on Google App Engine for fun and I'd like to include graphs so users can see some stats. Are there any free (either as in beer or speech) JavaScript libraries that can take a table or make some AJAX call and display a graph?</p>

<p>If you use jquery:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/flot/</a></p>
<p>A really easy way to understand this is to place the word "loop" after each of the keywords.  The terms now make sense if they are just read like everyday phrases.</p>

<p>break loop - looping is broken and stops</p>

<p>continue loop - loop continues to execute with the next iteration</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Specify a prototype size() function for Object</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>If anything else has been added to Object .prototype, then the suggested code will fail:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
Object.prototype.size = function () {

<p>I don't think that answer should be the accepted one as it can't be trusted to work if you have any other code running in the same execution context. To do it in a robust fashion surely you would need to define the size method within myArray and check for the type of the members as you iterate through them.</p>
<p>It's a "quirk" in the way the JVM looks up the zoneinfo file.  See <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6456628">Bug ID 6456628</a>.</p>

<p>The easiest workaround is to make /etc/localtime a symlink to the correct zoneinfo file.  For Pacific time, the following commands should work:</p>

<pre><code># sudo cp /etc/localtime /etc/localtime.dist<br># sudo ln -fs /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime<br></code></pre>

<p>I haven't had any problems with the symlink approach.</p>

<p>Edit: Added "sudo" to the commands.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to get class-like behavior in javascript, the most common seem to be prototype based like this:</p>

<pre><code>function Vector(x, y, x) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.z = z;
    return this;
}

Vector.prototype.length = function () { return Math.sqrt(this.x * this.x ... ); }
</code></pre>

<p>and closure based approaches similar to</p>

<pre><code>function Vector(x, y, z) {
    this.length = function() { return Math.sqrt(x * x + ...); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For various reasons the latter is faster, but I've seen (and I frequently do write) the prototype version and was curious as to what other people do.</p>

<p>It may help to double-check the timezone rules your OS is using.</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/zdump -v /etc/localtime | less<br></code></pre>

<p>This file should contain your daylight savings rules, like this one for the year 2080:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/localtime  Sun Mar 31 01:00:00 2080 UTC = Sun Mar 31 02:00:00 2080 BST isdst=1 gmtoff=3600<br></code></pre>

<p>You can compare this with the timezone rules you think you should be using. They can be found in <strong>/usr/share/zoneinfo/</strong>.</p>
<p>You also have the choice of:</p>

<pre><code>function Vector(x, y, z) {<br>  function length() {<br>    return Math.sqrt(x * x + ...);<br>  }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Which is probably just as slow as example two, but it looks more like Java/C# and is a bit more explicit.</p>
<p>I'd just let him write tons of code. Let him drive in everything you guys do, and just be available to answer questions.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, after a few months of writings tons of crappy code, he'll start to get the idea and start writing better programs. At that point, you can get bogged down in details (memory, etc), and also talk about general design principles.</p>

<p>I've heard that what separates the great artists from the mediocre ones, is that every time they practice, they improve on something, no matter how small. Let your brother practice, and he'll improve every time he sits down at the keyboard.</p>

But I think its still worthwhile to find methods to <em>guide</em> his practice.  No question, I want him writing as much code as he knows how to do.  Thats one reason I'm asking for sample projects.</p>

<p>Fortunately I get to use <a href="http://prototypejs.org/" rel="nofollow">prototype.js</a>, which provides some nice wrappers. So you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>var Person = Class.create({
    initialize: function(name) {
        this.name = name;
    },
    say: function(message) {
        return this.name + ': ' + message;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>I was taught by learning how to solve problems in a language agnostic way using flowcharts and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Design_Language" rel="nofollow">PDL</a> (Program Design Language).  After a couple weeks of that, I learned to convert the PDL I had written to a language.  I am glad I learned that way because I have spent the majority of my years programming, solving problems without being tied to a language.  What language I use has always been an implementation detail and not part of the design. </p>

<p>Having to solve the problem by breaking it down into it's basic steps is a key skill.  I think it is one of the things that separates those that can program from those that can't.</p>

<p>As far as how you tackle the order of concepts of a language I believe the easiest way is to decide that is to have a project in mind and tackle the concepts as they are needed.  This lets you apply them as they are needed on something that you are interested in doing.  When learning a language it is good to have several simple projects in mind and a few with progressive complexity.  Deciding on those will help you map out the concepts that are needed and their order.</p>
<p>Ruby unfortunately is a bit different. 
PS: My memory is a bit hazy on this so apologies if I'm wrong</p>

<p>instead of break/continue, it has break/next, which behave the same in terms of loops</p>

<p>Loops (like everything else) are expressions, and "return" the last thing that they did. Most of the time, getting the return value from a loop is pointless, so everyone just does this</p>

<pre><code>a = 5<br>while a &lt; 10<br>    a + 1<br>end<br></code></pre>

<p>You can however do this</p>

<pre><code>a = 5<br>b = while a &lt; 10<br>    a + 1<br>end # b is now 10<br></code></pre>

<p>HOWEVER, a lot of ruby code 'emulates' a loop by using a block.
The canonical example is</p>

<pre><code>10.times do |x|<br>    puts x<br>end<br></code></pre>

<p>As it is much more common for people to want to do things with the result of a block, this is where it gets messy.
break/next mean different things in the context of a block.</p>

<p>break will jump out of the code that called the block</p>

<p>next will skip the rest of the code in the block, and 'return' what you specify to the caller of the block. This doesn't make any sense without examples.</p>

<pre><code>def timesten<br>    10.times{ |t| puts yield t }<br>end<br><br><br>timesten do |x|<br>   x * 2<br>end<br># will print<br>2<br>4<br>6<br>8 ... and so on<br><br><br>timesten do |x|<br>    break<br>    x * 2<br>end<br># won't print anything. The break jumps out of the timesten function entirely, and the call to `puts` inside it gets skipped<br><br>timesten do |x|<br>    break 5<br>    x * 2<br>end<br># This is the same as above. it's "returning" 5, but nobody is catching it. If you did a = timesten... then a would get assigned to 5<br><br>timesten do |x|<br>    next 5<br>    x * 2<br>end <br># this would print<br>5<br>5<br>5 ... and so on, because 'next 5' skips the 'x * 2' and 'returns' 5.<br></code></pre>

<p>So yeah. Ruby is awesome, but it has some awful corner-cases. This is the second worst one I've seen in my years of using it :-)</p>
<p>It seems that a List object cannot be stored in a List variable in C#, and can't even be explicitly cast that way.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; sl = new List&lt;string&gt;();
List&lt;object&gt; ol;
ol = sl;
</code></pre>

<p>results in Cannot implicitly convert type <code>System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;object&gt;</code></p>

<p>And then...</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; sl = new List&lt;string&gt;();
List&lt;object&gt; ol;
ol = (List&lt;object&gt;)sl;
</code></pre>

<p>results in Cannot convert type <code>System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;object&gt;</code></p>

<p>Of course, you can do it by pulling everything out of the string list and putting it back in one at a time, but it is a rather convoluted solution.</p>

<p>The reason is that a generic class like <code>List&lt;&gt;</code> is, for most purposes, treated externally as a normal class. e.g. when you say <code>List&lt;string&gt;()</code> the compiler says <code>ListString()</code> (which contains strings). [Technical folk: this is an extremely plain-English-ified version of what's going on]</p>

<p>Consequently, obviously the compiler can't be smart enough to convert a ListString to a ListObject by casting the items of its internal collection.</p>

<p>That's why there's extension methods for IEnumerable like Convert() that allow you to easily supply conversion for the items stored inside a collection, which could be as simple as casting from one to another.</p>
<p>For the YUI users:</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/" rel="nofollow">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/</a></p>
<p>Think of it this way, if you were to do such a cast, and then add an object of type Foo to the list, the list of strings is no longer consistent.  If you were to iterate the first reference, you would get a class cast exception because once you hit the Foo instance, the Foo could not be converted to string!</p>

<p>As a side note, I think it would be more significant whether or not you can do the reverse cast:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;object&gt; ol = new List&lt;object&gt;();<br>List&lt;string&gt; sl;<br>sl = (List&lt;string&gt;)ol;<br></code></pre>

<p>I haven't used C# in a while, so I don't know if that is legal, but that sort of cast is actually (potentially) useful.  In this case, you are going from a more general class (object) to a more specific class (string) that extends from the general one.  In this way, if you add to the list of strings, you are not violating the list of objects.</p>

<p>Does anybody know or can test if such a cast is legal in C#?</p>
<p>Mike - I believe contravariance isn't allowed in C# either</p>

<p>See <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rmbyers/archive/2005/02/16/375079.aspx" rel="nofollow">Generic type parameter variance in the CLR</a> for some more info.</p>

<p>I noticed that a few people mentioned Flot but nobody mentioned <a href="http://solutoire.com/flotr/" rel="nofollow">Flotr</a>!  Also on Google Code <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flotr/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/flotr/</a>.</p>

<p>Check a JSON example, complete with the code to do it, <a href="http://www.solutoire.com/experiments/flotr/examples/json-data.html" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

<p>It requires the Prototype.js Javascript library and works in all modern browsers!</p>
<p>This has a lot to do with covariance, e.g., generic types are considered as parameters, and if the parameters do not resolve properly to a more specific type then the operation fails. The implication of such is that you really cannot cast to a more general type like object. And as stated by Rex, the List object won't convert each object for you.</p>

<p>You might want to try the ff code instead:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; sl = new List&lt;string&gt;();<br>//populate sl<br>List&lt;object&gt; ol = new List&lt;object&gt;(sl);<br></code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;object&gt; ol = new List&lt;object&gt;();<br>ol.AddRange(sl);<br></code></pre>

<p>ol will (theoretically) copy all the contents of sl without problems.</p>
<p>If you're using .NET 3.5 have a look at the Enumerable.Cast method. It's an extension method so you can call it directly on the List.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; sl = new List&lt;string&gt;();
IEnumerable&lt;object&gt; ol;
ol = sl.Cast&lt;object&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>It's not exactly what you asked for but should do the trick.</p>

<p>Edit: As noted by Zooba, you can then call ol.ToList() to get a List</p>

<p>How should I load files into my Java application?</p>
<p><strong>The short answer</strong></p>

<p>Use one of these two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResource(java.lang.String)" rel="nofollow"><code>Class.getResource(String)</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResourceAsStream(java.lang.String)" rel="nofollow"><code>Class.getResourceAsStream(String)</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>InputStream inputStream = YourClass.class.getResourceAsStream("image.jpg");
</code></pre>

<p>--</p>

<p><strong>The long answer</strong></p>

<p>Typically, one would not want to load files using absolute paths. For example, dont do this if you can help it:</p>

<pre><code>File file = new File("C:\\Users\\Joe\\image.jpg");
</code></pre>

<p>This technique is not recommended for at least two reasons. First, it creates a dependency on a particular operating system, which prevents the application from easily moving to another operating system. One of Javas main benefits is the ability to run the same bytecode on many different platforms. Using an absolute path like this makes the code much less portable.</p>

<p>Second, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the applications mobility. If the file exists outside the applications current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).</p>

<p>Instead, use the <code>getResource()</code> methods in the <code>Class</code> class. This makes the application much more portable. It  can be moved to different platforms, machines, or directories and still function correctly.</p>

<p>At work we are currently still using JUnit 3 to run our tests. We have been considering switching over to JUnit 4 for <strong>new</strong> tests being written but I have been keeping an eye on TestNG for a while now. What experiences have you all had with either JUnit 4 or TestNG, and which seems to work better for very large numbers of tests? Having flexibility in writing tests is also important to us since our functional tests cover a wide aspect and need to be written in a variety of ways to get results.</p>

<p>Old tests will not be re-written as they do their job just fine. What I would like to see in new tests though is flexibility in the way the test can be written, natural assertions, grouping, and easily distributed test executions.</p>

<p>First I would say, don't rewrite all your tests just to suit the latest fad.  Junit3 works perfectly well, and the introduction of annotations in 4 doesn't buy you very much (in my opinion).  It is much more important that you guys <em>write</em> tests, and it sounds like you do.  </p>

<p>Use whatever seems most natural and helps you get your work done.</p>

<p>I can't comment on TestNG b/c I haven't used it.  But I would recommend <a href="http://www.unitils.org/summary.html">unitils</a>, a great wrapper for JUnit/TestNG/DBUnit/EasyMock, regardless of which route you take. (It supports all the flavors mentioned above)</p>

<p>I've used both, but I have to agree with Justin Standard that you shouldn't really consider rewriting your existing tests to any new format.  Regardless of the decision, it is pretty trivial to run both.  TestNG strives to be much more configurable than JUnit, but in the end they both work equally well.</p>

<p>TestNG has a neat feature where you can mark tests as a particular group, and then easily run all tests of a specific group, or exclude tests of a particular group.  Thus you can mark tests that run slowly as in the "slow" group and then ignore them when you want quick results.  A suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as "checkin" tests which should be run whenever you check new files in.  I never saw such a feature in JUnit, but then again, if you don't have it, you don't REALLY miss it.</p>

<p>For all its claims of high configuration, I did run into a corner case the a couple weeks ago where I couldn't do what I wanted to do... I wish I could remember what it is, but I wanted to bring it up so you know that it's not perfect.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage TestNG has is annotations... which JUnit added in version 4 anyways.</p>
<p>getResource is fine, but using relative paths will work just as well too, as long as you can control where your working directory is (which you usually can).</p>

<p>Furthermore the platform dependence regarding the separator character can be gotten around using <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/File.html#separator">File.separator</a>, <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/File.html#separatorChar">File.separatorChar</a>, or <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#getProperties%28%29">System.getProperty("file.separator")</a>.</p>
<p>I'm still new to the ASP.NET world, so I could be way off base here, but so far this is to the best of my (limited) knowledge!</p>

<p>Lets say I have a standard business object "Contact" in the <em>Business</em> namespace. I write a Web Service to retrieve a Contact's info from a database, and return it. I then write a client application to request said details.</p>

<p>Now, I also then create a utility method that takes a "Contact" and does some magic with it, like <code>Utils.BuyContactNewHat()</code> say. Which of course takes the Contact of type <code>Business.Contact</code>.</p>

<p>I then go back to my client application and want to utilise the <code>BuyContactNewHat</code> method, so I add a reference to my <em>Utils</em> namespace and there it is. However, a problem arises with:</p>

<pre><code>Contact c = MyWebService.GetContact("Rob);
Utils.BuyContactNewHat(c); // &lt;&lt; Error Here
</code></pre>

<p>Since the return type of <code>GetContact</code> is of <code>MyWebService.Contact</code> and not <code>Business.Contact</code> as expected. I understand why this is, because when accessing a web service, you are actually programming against the proxy class generated by the WSDL.</p>

<p>So, is there an "easier" way to deal with this type mismatch? I was considering perhaps trying to create a generic converter class that uses reflection to ensure two objects have the same structure, than simply transferring the values across from one to the other.</p>

<p>I would recommend also watching some screencasts - they are generally created in context of a specific technology not a language, though if there's Python code displayed, that'll do :). The point is - they're created by some good programmers and watching how good programmers program is a good thing. You and your brother could do some peer programming as well, that might be an even better idea. Just don't forget to explain WHY you do something this way and not that way.
I think the best way to learn programming is from good examples and try not to even see the bad ones.</p>
<p>The most robust answer (i.e. that captures the intent of what you're trying to do while causing the fewest bugs) would be:</p>

<pre><code>Object.size = function(obj) {
    var size = 0, key;
    for (key in obj) {
        if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) size++;
    }
    return size;
};

// Get the size of an object
var size = Object.size(myArray);
</code></pre>

<p>There's a sort of convention in JavaScript that you <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10757455/object-prototype-is-verboten">don't add things to Object.prototype</a>, because it can break enumerations in various libraries. Adding methods to Object is usually safe, though.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Here's an update as of 2016 and <a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/">widespread deployment of ES5</a> and beyond.</strong>  For IE9+ and all other modern ES5+ capable browsers, you can use <code>Object.keys()</code> so the above code just becomes:</p>

<pre><code>var size = Object.keys(myObj).length;
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't have to modify any existing prototype since <code>Object.keys()</code> is now built in.</p>

<p>About a year ago, we had the same problem. I spent sometime considering which move was better, and eventually we realized that TestNG has no 'killer features'. It's nice, and has some features JUnit 4 doesn't have, but we don't need them.<br>
We didn't want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know TestNG because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests.<br>
Also, JUnit is pretty much the de-facto standard in the Java world. There's no decent tool that doesn't support it from the box, you can find a lot of help on the web and they added a lot of new features in the past year which shows it's alive.</p>

<p>We decided to stick with JUnit and never looked back.</p>

<p>Your code not really compliant with <a href="http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm" rel="nofollow">full CSV format</a>. If you are just generating CSV from data that has no commas, leading/trailing spaces, tabs, newlines or quotes, it should be fine.

        line.Append(csvField);
    }

    return line.ToString();

static String EncodeCsvField(String field)
{

    sb.Append(field);

         sb[0] == '\t' ||
         sb[sb.Length-1] == ' ' ||

    {
        embedInQuotes = true;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; sb.Length; i++)
    {
        // Embed in quotes to preserve: commas, line-breaks etc.
        if (sb[i] == DelimiterChar || 
            sb[i]=='\r' || 
            sb[i]=='\n' || 
            sb[i] == '"') 
        { 
            embedInQuotes = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    // If the field itself has quotes, they must each be represented 
    // by a pair of consecutive quotes.
    sb.Replace("\"", "\"\"");

    String rv = sb.ToString();

    if (embedInQuotes)
    {
        rv = "\"" + rv + "\"";
    }

    return rv;
}

<p>Might not be world's most efficient code, but it has been tested. Real world sucks compared to quick sample code :)</p>

<p>Sorry for the confusion</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The performance of a concatenation operation for a String or StringBuilder object depends on how often a memory allocation occurs. A String concatenation operation always allocates memory, whereas a StringBuilder concatenation operation only allocates memory if the StringBuilder object buffer is too small to accommodate the new data. Consequently, the String class is preferable for a concatenation operation if a fixed number of String objects are concatenated. In that case, the individual concatenation operations might even be combined into a single operation by the compiler. A StringBuilder object is preferable for a concatenation operation if an arbitrary number of strings are concatenated; for example, if a loop concatenates a random number of strings of user input. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>When you release a new version of your CSS or JS libraries, cause the following to occur:</p>

<ol>
<li>modify the filename to include a unique version string</li>
<li>modify the HTML files which reference the library to point at the versioned file</li>
</ol>

<p>(this is usually a pretty simple matter for a release script)</p>

<p>Now you can set the Expires for the CSS/JS to be years in the future.  Whenever you change the content, if the referencing HTML points to a new URI, browsers will no longer use the old cached copy.</p>

<p>This causes the caching behavior you want without requiring anything of the user.</p>
<p>I think in most cases like this clarity, and not efficiency, should be your biggest concern.  Unless you're crushing together tons of strings, or building something for a lower powered mobile device, this probably won't make much of a dent in your run speed.</p>

<p>I've found that, in cases where I'm building strings in a fairly linear fashion, either doing straight concatenations or using StringBuilder is your best option.  I suggest this in cases where the majority of the string that you're building is dynamic.  Since very little of the text is static, the most important thing is that it's clear where each piece of dynamic text is being put in case it needs updated in the future.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you're talking about a big chunk of static text with two or three variables in it, even if it's a little less efficient, I think the clarity you gain from string.Format makes it worth it.  I used this earlier this week when having to place one bit of dynamic text in the center of a 4 page document.  It'll be easier to update that big chunk of text if its in one piece than having to update three pieces that you concatenate together.</p>
<p>I was hoping someone could help me out with a problem I'm having using the java search function in Eclipse on a particular project.</p>

<p>When using the java search on one particular project, I get an error message saying <code>Class file name must end with .class</code> (see stack trace below). This does not seem to be happening on all projects, just one particular one, so perhaps there's something I should try to get rebuilt?</p>

<p>I have already tried <code>Project -&gt; Clean</code>... and Closing Eclipse, deleting all the built class files and restarting Eclipse to no avail.</p>

<p>The only reference I've been able to find on Google for the problem is at <a href="http://www.crazysquirrel.com/computing/java/eclipse/error-during-java-search.jspx">http://www.crazysquirrel.com/computing/java/eclipse/error-during-java-search.jspx</a>, but unfortunately his solution (closing, deleting class files, restarting) did not work for me.</p>

<p>Thanks McDowell, closing and opening the project seems to have fixed it (at least for now).</p>

<p><code>String.Format</code> uses a <code>StringBuilder</code> internally:</p>

<pre><code>public static string Format(IFormatProvider provider, string format, params object[] args)
{
    if ((format == null) || (args == null))
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException((format == null) ? "format" : "args");
    }

    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(format.Length + (args.Length * 8));
    builder.AppendFormat(provider, format, args);
    return builder.ToString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code is a snippet from mscorlib, so the question becomes "is <code>StringBuilder.Append()</code> faster than <code>StringBuilder.AppendFormat()</code>"? </p>

<p>Without benchmarking I'd probably say that the code sample above would run more quickly using <code>.Append()</code>. But it's a guess, try benchmarking and/or profiling the two to get a proper comparison.</p>

<p>This chap, Jerry Dixon, did some benchmarking:</p>

<p>At the end of the day it depends whether your string formatting is going to be called repetitively, i.e. you're doing some serious text processing over 100's of megabytes of text, or whether it's being called when a user clicks a button now and again. Unless you're doing some huge batch processing job I'd stick with String.Format, it aids code readability. If you suspect a perf bottleneck then stick a profiler on your code and see where it really is.</p>

<p>Robert Read wrote a useful guide, <a href="http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html" rel="nofollow">How to be a Programmer</a>, which covers a wide area of programming issues that a beginner would find helpful.</p>

  <p>In both cases above I want to inject one or more strings into the middle of a predefined template string.</p>

<p>In which case, I would suggest String.Format is the quickest because it is design for that exact purpose.</p>
<p>Two more general-purpose mechanisms for fixing some of Eclipse's idiosyncrasies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Close and open the project</li>
<li>Delete the project (but not from disk!) and reimport it as an existing project</li>
</ul>

<p>Failing that, <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&amp;order=relevance+desc&amp;bug_status=__all__&amp;product=JDT&amp;content=Class+file+name+must+end+with+.class">bugs.eclipse.org</a> might provide the answer.</p>

<p>If the workspace is caching something broken, you may be able to delete it by poking around in <strong>workspace/.metadata/.plugins</strong>. Most of that stuff is fairly transient (though backup and watch for deleted preferences).</p>
<p>I ran some quick performance benchmarks, and for 100,000 operations averaged over 10 runs, the first method (String Builder) takes almost half the time of the second (String Format).</p>

<p>So, if this is infrequent, it doesn't matter. But if it is a common operation, then you may want to use the first method.</p>
<p>Oh also, the fastest would be:</p>

<p>I'm trying to use the CoreCon API in Visual Studio 2008 to programmatically launch device emulators. When I call <code>device.Connect()</code>, I inexplicably get a DirectoryNotFoundException. I get it if I try it in PowerShell or in C# Console Application. Here's the code I'm using:</p>

     foreach (var p in platforms)
     {
        Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", p.Name, p.Id);
     }

     Platform platform = platforms[3];
     Console.WriteLine("Selected {0}", platform.Name);

     Device device = platform.GetDevices()[0];
     device.Connect();

     SystemInfo info = device.GetSystemInfo();
     Console.WriteLine("System OS Version:{0}.{1}.{2}",info.OSMajor, info.OSMinor, info.OSBuildNo);

     Console.ReadLine();

<p>Does anyone know why I'm getting this error? I'm running this on WinXP 32-bit, plain jane Visual Studio 2008 Pro. I imagine it's some config issue since I can't do it from a Console app or PowerShell.</p>

<p>On the assumption that you're building apps targeted at Windows:</p>

<ul>
<li>it can sure be informative to understand lower levels of the system - how they work, how your code interacts with them (even if only indirectly), and where you have additional options that aren't available in the higher-level abstractions</li>
<li>there are times when your code might not be as efficient, high-performance or precise enough for your requirements</li>
<li>However, in more and more cases, folks like us (who never learned "unmanaged coding") will be able to pull off the programming we're trying to do without "learning" Win32.</li>
<li>Further, there's plenty of sites that provide working samples, code fragments and even fully-functional source code that you can "leverage" (borrow, plagiarize - but check that you're complying with any re-use license or copyright!) to fill in any gaps that aren't handled by the .NET framework class libraries (or the libraries that you can download or license).</li>
<li>If you can pull off the feats you need without messing around in Win32, and you're doing a good job of developing well-formed, readable managed code, then I'd say mastering .NET would be a better choice than spreading yourself thin over two very different environments.</li>
<li>If you frequently need to leverage those features of Windows that haven't received good Framework class library coverage, then by all means, learn the skills you need.</li>
<li>I've personally spent far too much time worrying about the "other areas" of coding that I'm <em>supposed</em> to understand to produce "good programs", but there's plenty of masochists out there that think everyone's needs and desires are like their own.  Misery loves company.  :)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the assumption that you're building apps for the "Web 2.0" world, or that would be just as useful/beneficial to *NIX &amp; MacOS users:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stick with languages and compilers that target as many cross-platform environments as possible.</li>
<li>pure .NET in Visual Studio is better than Win32 obviously, but developing against the MONO libraries, perhaps using the Sharp Develop IDE, is probably an even better approach.</li>
<li>you could also spend your time learning Java, and those skills would transfer very well to C# programming (plus the Java code would theoretically run on any platform with the matching JRE).  I've heard it said that Java is more like "write once, debug everywhere", but that's probably as true as (or even moreso than) C#.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a way to implement a singleton object in C++ that is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lazily constructed in a thread safe manner (two threads might simultaneously be the first user of the singleton - it should still only be constructed once).</li>
<li>Doesn't rely on static variables being constructed beforehand (so the singleton object is itself safe to use during the construction of static variables).</li>
</ol>

<p>(I don't know my C++ well enough, but is it the case that integral and constant static variables are initialized before any code is executed (ie, even before static constructors are executed - their values may already be "initialized" in the program image)?  If so - perhaps this can be exploited to implement a singleton mutex - which can in turn be used to guard the creation of the real singleton..)</p>

<hr>

<p>Excellent, it seems that I have a couple of good answers now (shame I can't mark 2 or 3 as being <strong>the answer</strong>).  There appears to be two broad solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use static initialisation (as opposed to dynamic initialisation) of a POD static variable, and implementing my own mutex with that using the builtin atomic instructions.  This was the type of solution I was hinting at in my question, and I believe I knew already.</li>
<li>Use some other library function like <a href="http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_once.html">pthread_once</a> or <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_33_1/doc/html/call_once.html">boost::call_once</a>.  These I certainly didn't know about - and am very grateful for the answers posted.</li>

<p>If I'm reading this properly, you're starting work items on bunch of threads but you're concerned that the threads are completing out of order, and, would prefer to wait until each thread completes in the order they were started ? </p>

<p>If this is the case then I'm not sure why you're creating a thread per work item. Maybe you could expand?</p>

<p>If you did need to wait for a thread to complete the you could just do:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Matt's answer features what's called <em>double-checked locking</em> which isn't supported by the C/C++ memory model.  (It is supported by the Java 1.5 and later  and I think .NET  memory model.)  This means that between the time when the <code>pObj == NULL</code> check takes place and when the lock (mutex) is acquired, <code>pObj</code> may have already been assigned on another thread.  Thread switching happens whenever the OS wants it to, not between "lines" of a program (which have no meaning post-compilation in most languages).</p>

<p>Furthermore, as Matt acknowledges, he uses an <code>int</code> as a lock rather than an OS primitive.  Don't do that.  Proper locks require the use of memory barrier instructions, potentially cache-line flushes, and so on; use your operating system's primitives for locking.  This is especially important because the primitives used can change between the individual CPU lines that your operating system runs on; what works on a CPU Foo might not work on CPU Foo2.  Most operating systems either natively support POSIX threads (pthreads) or offer them as a wrapper for the OS threading package, so it's often best to illustrate examples using them.</p>

<p>If your operating system offers appropriate primitives, and if you absolutely need it for performance, instead of doing this type of locking/initialization you can use an <em>atomic compare and swap</em> operation to initialize a shared global variable.  Essentially, what you write will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>MySingleton *MySingleton::GetSingleton() {
    if (pObj == NULL) {
        // create a temporary instance of the singleton
        MySingleton *temp = new MySingleton();
        if (OSAtomicCompareAndSwapPtrBarrier(NULL, temp, &amp;pObj) == false) {
            // if the swap didn't take place, delete the temporary instance
            delete temp;
        }
    }

    return pObj;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This only works if it's safe to create multiple instances of your singleton (one per thread that happens to invoke GetSingleton() simultaneously), and then throw extras away.  The <code>OSAtomicCompareAndSwapPtrBarrier</code> function provided on Mac OS X  most operating systems provide a similar primitive  checks whether <code>pObj</code> is <code>NULL</code> and only actually sets it to <code>temp</code> to it if it is.  This uses hardware support to really, literally only perform the swap <em>once</em> and tell whether it happened.</p>

<p>Another facility to leverage if your OS offers it that's in between these two extremes is <code>pthread_once</code>.  This lets you set up a function that's run only once - basically by doing all of the locking/barrier/etc. trickery for you - no matter how many times it's invoked or on how many threads it's invoked.</p>

<P>I have a quad core machine and would like to write some code to parse a text file that takes advantage of all four cores. The text file basically contains one record per line.</P>
<P>Multithreading isn't my forte so I'm wondering if anyone could give me some patterns that I might be able to use to parse the file in an optimal manner.</P>
<P>My first thoughts are to read all the lines into some sort of queue and then spin up threads to pull the lines off the queue and process them, but that means the queue would have to exist in memory and these are faily large files so I'm not so keen on that idea.</P>
<P>My next thoughts are to have some sort of controller that will read in a line and assign it a thread to parse, but I'm not sure if the controller will end up being a bottleneck if the threads are processing the lines faster than it can read and assign them.</P>
<P>I know there's probably another simpler solution than both of these but at the moment I'm just not seeing it.</P>
<P>I'd go with your original idea. If you are concerned that the queue might get too large implement a buffer-zone for it (i.e. If is gets above 100 lines the stop reading the file and if it gets below 20 then start reading again. You'd need to do some testing to find the optimal barriers). Make it so that any of the threads can potentially be the "reader thread" as it has to lock the queue to pull an item out anyway it can also check to see if the "low buffer region" has been hit and start reading again. While it's doing this the other threads can read out the rest of the queue.</P>
<P>Or if you prefer, have one reader thread assign the lines to three other <EM>processor</EM> threads (via their own queues) and implement a <A href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=324133.324234" rel="nofollow">work-stealing strategy</A>. I've never done this so I don't know how hard it is.</P>
<p>My experience is with Java, not C#, so apologies if these solutions don't apply.</p>

<p>The immediate solution I can think up off the top of my head would be to have an executor that runs 3 threads (using <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Executors</code></a><code>.newFixedThreadPool</code>, say). For each line/record read from the input file, fire off a job at the executor (using <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ExecutorService</code></a><code>.submit</code>). The executor will queue requests for you, and allocate between the 3 threads.</p>

<p>Probably better solutions exist, but hopefully that will do the job. :-)</p>

<p>ETA: Sounds a lot like Wolfbyte's second solution. :-)</p>

<p>ETA2: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadpool.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>System.Threading.ThreadPool</code></a> sounds like a very similar idea in .NET. I've never used it, but it may be worth your while!</p>
<p>I have been using <code>PHP</code> and <code>Javascript</code> for building my dads website.  He wants to incorporate a login system into his website.  I have the design for the login system using PHP, my problem is how do I show buttons if the person is logged in.</p>

<p><strong>For Example -</strong> You have Home, Products, About Us, and Contact.  Well I want to have buttons for Dealer, Distributor, and maybe other information if the user is logged in.  So I will have Home, Products, About Us, Contacts, Dealer (if dealer login), Distributor (if distributor login), and so forth.  </p>

<p>Would <code>Javascript</code> be a good way to do this or would php, maybe even both.  Using Javascript to show and hide buttons, and php to check to see which buttons to show.</p>

<p>If you use javascript to hide the buttons, you open a security hole in the application. A malicious user could either disable javascript or apply some of their own to get around your security.</p>

<p>I suggest using PHP to chose to either render the buttons or not. I do this in .NET quite often. </p>

<p>You should be able to check the user's access on the server-side whenever they try to use a restricted button as well.</p>
<p>I have a data structure that represents a directed graph, and I want to render that dynamically on an HTML page.  These graphs will usually be just a few nodes, maybe ten at the very upper end, so my guess is that performance isn't going to be a big deal. Ideally, I'd like to be able to hook it in with jQuery so that users can tweak the layout manually by dragging the nodes around.</p>

<p>Note: I'm not looking for a charting library.</p>

<p>While this question has already been answered, I think there are some other points to mention:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want lazy-instantiation of the singleton while using a pointer to a dynamically allocated instance, you'll have to make sure you clean it up at the right point.</li>
<li>You could use Matt's solution, but you'd need to use a proper mutex/critical section for locking, and by checking "pObj == NULL" both before and after the lock. Of course, <strong>pObj</strong> would also have to be <em>static</em> ;)
.
A mutex would be unnecessarily heavy in this case, you'd be better going with a critical section.</li>
</ul>

<p>But as already stated, you can't guarantee threadsafe lazy-initialisation without using at least one synchronisation primitive.</p>

<p>Edit: Yup Derek, you're right. My bad. :)</p>

<p>This will eliminate bottlenecks of having a single thread do the reading:</p>

<pre><code>open file<br>for each thread n=0,1,2,3:<br>    seek to file offset 1/n*filesize<br>    scan to next complete line<br>    process all lines in your part of the file<br></code></pre>
<blockquote>

<p>OJ, that doesn't work.  As Chris pointed out, that's double-check locking, which is not guaranteed to work in the current C++ standard.  See: <a href="http://www.ddj.com/184405726" rel="nofollow">C++ and the Perils of Double-Checked Locking</a></p>

<p>Edit: No problem, OJ.  It's really nice in languages where it does work.  I expect it will work in C++0x (though I'm not certain), because it's such a convenient idiom.</p>

<p>Mark's answer is the simpler, more elegant solution.  Why build a complex program with inter-thread communication if it's not necessary?  Spawn 4 threads.  Each thread calculates size-of-file/4 to determine it's start point (and stop point).  Each thread can then work entirely independently.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> reason to add a special thread to handle reading is if you expect some lines to take a very long time to process <em>and</em> you expect that these lines are clustered in a single part of the file.  Adding inter-thread communication when you don't need it is a <em>very bad idea</em>.  You greatly increase the chance of introducing an unexpected bottleneck and/or synchronization bugs.</p>

<p>Is the PC likely to have Acrobat installed? I think Acrobat installs a shell extension so previews of the first page of a PDF document appear in Windows Explorer's thumbnail view.

<p>What are the guidelines for the use of each? And what are the differences?</p>

<p>Is your scripting language bytecode generating? Does it generate debug metadata? If so, bytecode instrumentation is probably the way to go. In fact existing tools like will probably work; perhaps with minimal modification (the typical problem is the tools are written to work with Java and assume com.foo.Bar.class corresponds to com/foo/Bar.java. Unwinding that assumption can be tedious.) <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a> is a ClassLoader that does byte-code re-writing for code-coverage collection in Java. The coding style is a little funky, but I recommend reading the source for some ideas.</p>

<p>If your scripting language is interpreted then you will need something higher-level (source level) that hooks into the interpreter.</p>

<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/362314fe.aspx"><code>string</code></a> is an alias in C# for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.aspx"><code>System.String</code></a>.  So technically, there is no difference.  It's like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/62503/c-int-or-int32-should-i-care"><code>int</code> <em>vs.</em> <code>System.Int32</code></a>.</p>

<p>But int automatically references <code>System.Int32</code> because it is the default, while there are many other integer(<code>int</code>) types. Using <code>int</code> just defaults to the 32 bit integer if you dont explicitly tell in your code what type of integer it should expect. If you reference <code>Int16</code> instead of int, you will specify the type from the default <code>Int32</code>.</p>

<p>As far as guidelines, I think it's generally recommended to use <code>string</code> any time you're referring to an object.  </p>

<p>e.g. </p>

<pre><code>string place = "world";
</code></pre>

<p>Likewise, I think it's generally recommended to use <code>String</code> if you need to refer specifically to the class.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>string greet = String.Format("Hello {0}!", place);
</code></pre>

<p>This is the style that Microsoft tends to use in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.String.Format.aspx#Format1_Example">their examples</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>It appears that the guidance in this area may have changed, as <a href="http://stylecop.codeplex.com/">StyleCop</a> now enforces the use of the C# specific aliases.</p>

<p><code>System.String</code> is THE .net string class - in C# <code>string</code> is an alias for <code>System.String</code> - so in use they are the same.</p>

<p>As for guidelines I wouldn't get too bogged down and just use whichever you feel like - there are more important things in life and the code is going to be the same anyway.</p>

<p>If you find yourselves building systems where it is necessary to specify the size of the integers you are using and so tend to use <code>Int16</code>, <code>Int32</code>, <code>UInt16</code>, <code>UInt32</code> etc. then it might look more natural to use <code>String</code> - and when moving around between different .net languages it might make things more understandable - otherwise I would use string and int.</p>

<p>One other way to do it is to use:</p>

<pre><code>String.valueOf(myInt);
</code></pre>

<p>This method is overloaded for every primitive type and <code>Object</code>. This way you don't even have to think about the type you're using. Implementations of the method will call the appropriate method of the given type for you, e.g. <code>Integer.toString(myInt)</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding security, <strong>you cannot trust what comes from the client</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The visitor can see all your code (HTML and Javascript, not PHP) and try stuff</li>
<li>The visitor may not even use a browser; it's trivially easy to send a request with a script</li>

<p>This means hiding the buttons is good User Interface design (because you can't use them if you are not logged in). But it's not a security feature. The security feature is checking, on the server, that the visitor is logged in before each action that requires it.</p>

<p>If you don't intend to show the buttons, it's not useful to send the HTML and images to the browser and then hide them with Javascript. I would check with PHP.</p>

<p>Valters, you cannot establish global aliases in the style of <code>string</code>, <code>int</code>, etc. so far as I know.  However, you can do more localized aliasing for types and namespaces with the <code>using</code> keyword.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>using str = System.String;
//...
str s = "Now you've got another alias for string!";
</code></pre>

<p>See here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sf0df423.aspx">using Directive (C# Reference)</a></p>

<p>In other words, is this Singleton implementation thread safe:</p>

<pre><code>public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() { }

    static Singleton()
    {
        instance = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get { return instance; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm" rel="nofollow" title="Modern Compiler Implementation in Java">Common Language Infrastructure specification</a> guarantees that "a type initializer shall run exactly once for any given type, unless explicitly called by user code." (Section 9.5.3.1.) So unless you have some whacky IL on the loose calling Singleton::.cctor directly (unlikely) your static constructor will run exactly once before the Singleton type is used, only one instance of Singleton will be created, and your Instance property is thread-safe.</p>

<p>Note that if Singleton's constructor accesses the Instance property (even indirectly) then the Instance property will be null. The best you can do is detect when this happens and throw an exception, by checking that instance is non-null in the property accessor. After your static constructor completes the Instance property will be non-null.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7095#7105" rel="nofollow" title="Modern Compiler Implementation in C">Zoomba's answer</a> points out you will need to make Singleton safe to access from multiple threads, or implement a locking mechanism around using the singleton instance.</p>

<p>Static constructors are guaranteed to be run only once per application domain, before any instances of a class are created or any static members are accessed. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645612.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645612.aspx</a></p>

<p>The implementation shown is thread safe for the initial construction, that is, no locking or null testing is required for constructing the Singleton object. However, this does not mean that any use of the instance will be synchronised. There are a variety of ways that this can be done; I've shown one below.</p>

<pre><code>public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton instance;
    // Added a static mutex for synchronising use of instance.
    private static System.Threading.Mutex mutex;
    private Singleton() { }
    static Singleton()
    {
        instance = new Singleton();
        mutex = new System.Threading.Mutex();
    }

    public static Singleton Acquire()
    {
        mutex.WaitOne();
        return instance;
    }

    // Each call to Acquire() requires a call to Release()
    public static void Release()
    {
        mutex.ReleaseMutex();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using a static constructor actually <em>is</em> threadsafe.  The static constructor is guaranteed to be executed only once.</p>

<p>From the C# language specification <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645612(VS.71).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645612(VS.71).aspx</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The static constructor for a class executes at most once in a given application domain. The execution of a static constructor is triggered by the first of the following events to occur within an application domain:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>An instance of the class is created.</li>
  <li>Any of the static members of the class are referenced.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, you can trust that your singleton will be correctly instantiated.</p>

<p>Zooba made an excellent point (and 15 seconds before me, too!) that the static constructor will not guarantee thread-safe shared access to the singleton.  That will need to be handled in another manner.</p>

<p>Static constructors are guaranteed to fire only once per App Domain so your approach should be OK. However, it is functionally no different from the more concise, inline version:</p>

<pre><code>private static readonly Singleton instance = new Singleton();
</code></pre>

<p>Thread safety is more of an issue when you are lazily initializing things.</p>

<p>You cannot cast between generic types with different type parameters. Specialized generic types don't form part of the same inheritance tree and so are unrelated types.</p>

<p>To do this pre-NET 3.5:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; sl = new List&lt;string&gt;();
// Add strings to sl

List&lt;object&gt; ol = new List&lt;object&gt;();

foreach(string s in sl)
{
    ol.Add((object)s);  // The cast is performed implicitly even if omitted
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using Linq:</p>

<pre><code>var sl = new List&lt;string&gt;();
// Add strings to sl

var ol = new List&lt;object&gt;(sl.Cast&lt;object&gt;());

// OR
var ol = sl.Cast&lt;object&gt;().ToList();

// OR (note that the cast to object here is required)
var ol = sl.Select(s =&gt; (object)s).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://qt.nokia.com/" rel="nofollow">Qt</a> has also a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" rel="nofollow">Regular Expression</a> implementation <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qregexp.html" rel="nofollow">QRegExp</a>. It is also platform independent.</p>

<p>That's actually so that you don't try to put any odd "object" in your "ol" list variant (as <code>List&lt;object&gt;</code> would seem to allow) - because your code would crash then (because the list really is <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> and will only accept String type objects). That's why you can't cast your variable to a more general specification.</p>

<p>On Java it's the other way around, you don't have generics, and instead everything is List of object at runtime, and you really can stuff any strange object in your supposedly-strictly typed List. Search for "Reified generics" to see a wider discussion of java's problem...</p>

<p>I'm trying to alpha blend sprites and backgrounds with <a href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" rel="nofollow" title="BenQ X-Touch">devkitPro</a> (including libnds, libarm, etc).</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to do this?</p>

<p>The main application that my division sells does something very similar to provide client customisations (which means that I can't post any source). We have a C# application that loads dynamic VB.NET scripts (although any .NET language could be easily supported - VB was chosen because the customisation team came from an ASP background).</p>

<p>Using .NET's CodeDom we compile the scripts from the database, using the VB <code>CodeDomProvider</code> (annoyingly it defaults to .NET 2, if you want to support 3.5 features you need to pass a dictionary with "CompilerVersion" = "v3.5" to its constructor). Use the <code>CodeDomProvider.CompileAssemblyFromSource</code> method to compile it (you can pass settings to force it to compile in memory only.</p>

<p>This would result in hundreds of assemblies in memory, but you could put all the dynamic classes' code together into a single assembly, and recompile the whole lot when any change. This has the advantage that you could add a flag to compile on disk with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_database" rel="nofollow">PDB</a> for when you're testing, allowing you to debug through the dynamic code.</p>

<p>What I want to do is something like this: I have enums with combined flagged values.</p>

<pre><code>public static class EnumExtension
{
    public static bool IsSet&lt;T&gt;( this T input, T matchTo ) 
        where T:enum //the constraint I want that doesn't exist in C#3
    {    
     return (input &amp; matchTo) != 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So then I could do:</p>

<pre><code>MyEnum tester = MyEnum.FlagA | MyEnum.FlagB

if( tester.IsSet( MyEnum.FlagA ) )
    //act on flag a
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately C#'s generic where constraints have no enum restriction, only class and struct. C# doesn't see enums as structs (even though they are value types) so I can't add extension types like this.</p>

<p>Anyone know a workaround?</p>

<p>I'm part of a team that develops a pretty big Swing Java Applet. Most of our code are legacy and there are tons of singleton references. We've bunched all of them to a single "Application Context" singleton. What we now need is to create some way to separate the shared context (shared across all applets currently showing) and non-shared context (specific to each applet currently showing). </p>

<p>However, we don't have an ID at each of the locations that call to the singleton, nor do we want to propagate the ID to all locations. What's the easiest way to identify in which applet context we're running? (I've tried messing with classloaders, thread groups, thread ids... so far I could find nothing that will enable me to ID the origin of the call).</p>

<p>As Sebastjan said, <strong>you first have to sort your data. This is important.</strong></p>

<p>The part I didn't get is that in the example construction</p>

<pre><code>groups = []
uniquekeys = []
for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list
   uniquekeys.append(k)
</code></pre>

<p><code>k</code> is the current grouping key, and <code>g</code> is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the <code>groupby</code> iterator itself returns iterators.</p>

<p>Here's an example of that, using clearer variable names:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import groupby

things = [("animal", "bear"), ("animal", "duck"), ("plant", "cactus"), ("vehicle", "speed boat"), ("vehicle", "school bus")]

for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    for thing in group:
        print "A %s is a %s." % (thing[1], key)
    print " "
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you the output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bear is a animal.<br>
  A duck is a animal.</p>
  
  <p>A cactus is a plant.</p>
  
  <p>A speed boat is a vehicle.<br>
  A school bus is a vehicle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, <code>things</code> is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. </p>

<p>The <code>groupby()</code> function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. </p>

<p>Here, <code>lambda x: x[0]</code> tells <code>groupby()</code> to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.</p>

<p>In the above <code>for</code> statement, <code>groupby</code> returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.</p>

<p>Here's a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    listOfThings = " and ".join([thing[1] for thing in group])
    print key + "s:  " + listOfThings + "."
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you the output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>animals: bear and duck.<br>
  plants: cactus.<br>
  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Darren, that would work if the types were specific enumerations - for general enumerations to work you have to cast them to ints (or more likely uint) to do the boolean math:</p>

<pre><code>public static bool IsSet( this Enum input, Enum matchTo )
{
    return ( Convert.ToUInt32( input ) &amp; Convert.ToUInt32( matchTo ) ) != 0;
}
</code></pre>

  <p>@Derek &amp; Mark: I wish there was a way to accept 2 answers. I'm going to have to end up going with Wolfbyte's solution because if I split the file into n sections there is the potential for a thread to come across a batch of "slow" transactions, however if I was processing a file where each process was guaranteed to require an equal amount of processing then I really like your solution of just splitting the file into chunks and assigning each chunk to a thread and being done with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No worries.  If clustered "slow" transactions is a issue, then the queuing solution is the way to go.  Depending on how fast or slow the average transaction is, you might also want to look at assigning multiple lines at a time to each worker.  This will cut down on synchronization overhead.  Likewise, you might need to optimize your buffer size.  Of course, both of these are optimizations that you should probably only do after profiling.  (No point in worrying about synchronization if it's not a bottleneck.)</p>

<p>I've made many different seperate parts of a GUI system for the Nintendo DS, like buttons and textboxes and select boxes, but I need a way of containing these classes in one Gui class, so that I can draw everything to the screen all at once, and check all the buttons at once to check if any are being pressed. My question is what is the best way organize all the classes (such as buttons and textboxes) into one GUI class?</p>

<p>Here's one way I thought of but it doesn't seem right:</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm using C++.</p>

<pre><code>class Gui {
    public:
        void update_all();
        void draw_all() const;
        int add_button(Button *button); // Returns button id
        void remove_button(int button_id);
    private:
        Button *buttons[10];
        int num_buttons;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code has a few problems, but I just wanted to give you an idea of what I want.</p>

<p>One useful strategy to keep in mind might be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern" rel="nofollow" title="ISO Address">composite pattern</a>. At a low level, it might allow you to treat all GUI objects (and collections of objects) more easily once built. But I have no idea what's involved in GUI framework design, so one place to find general inspiration is in the source code of an existing project. <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow" title="Bootstrap">WxWidgets</a> is a cross-platform GUI framework with source available. Good luck with your project!</p>

<p>I think looking at the way other GUI toolkits have done it would be an excellent place to start. For C++ examples, I hear lots of good things about <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/" rel="nofollow" title="ISO Address">Qt</a>. I haven't used it personally though. And of course WxWidgets as Nick mentioned.</p>

<p>There have already been a bunch of great answers, but for an absolute beginner, I would wholeheartedly recommend <a href="http://hacketyhack.net/" rel="nofollow" title="ISO Address">Hackety Hack</a>. It was created by the unreasonably prolific <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/" rel="nofollow" title="Bootstrap">why<em>the</em>lucky_stiff</a> specifically to provide a BASIC/LOGO/Pascal-like environment for new programmers to experiment in. It's essentially a slick Ruby IDE with some great libraries (flash video, IM, web server) and interactive lessons. It makes a good pitch for programming, as it chose lessons that do fun, useful things. "Hello, world" may not impress right off the bat, but  creating a custom IM client in 20 minutes can inspire someone to keep learning. Have fun!</p>

<p>So, I need some help. I am working on a project in C++. However, I think I have somehow managed to corrupt my heap. This is based off the fact that I added a <code>std::string</code> to a class and assigning it a value from another <code>std::string</code>:</p>

<pre><code>std::string hello = "Hello, world.\n";
/* exampleString = "Hello, world.\n" would work fine. */
exampleString = hello;
</code></pre>

<p>crashes on my system with a stack dump. So basically I need to <strong>stop</strong> and go through all my code and memory management stuff and find out where I've screwed up. The codebase is still small (about 1000 lines), so this is easily do-able. </p>

<p>Still, I'm over my head with this kind of stuff, so I thought I'd throw it out there. I'm on a Linux system, and have poked around with <code>valgrind</code>, and while not knowing completely what I'm doing, it did report that the <code>std::string</code>'s destructor was an invalid free. I have to admit to getting the term 'Heap Corruption' from a Google search; any general purpose articles on this sort of stuff would be appreciated as well.</p>

<p>(In before <code>rm -rf ProjectDir</code>, do again in C# :D)</p>

<p>EDIT:
I haven't made it clear, but what I'm asking for are ways an advice of diagnosing these sort of memory problems. I know the std::string stuff is right, so it's something I've done (or a bug, but there's Not A Problem With Select). I'm sure I could chuck the code I've written up and you very smart folks would see the problem in no time, but I want to add this kind of code analysis to my 'toolbox', as it were.</p>

<p>Since the bottleneck will generally be in the processing and not the reading when dealing with files I'd go with the <a href="http://www.ddj.com/architect/184401751" rel="nofollow" title="ISO Address">producer-consumer</a> pattern. To avoid locking I'd look at lock free lists. Since you are using C# you can take a look at Julian Bucknall's <a href="http://www.boyet.com/Articles/LockfreeFreeList.html" rel="nofollow" title="Bootstrap">Lock-Free List</a> code.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell your code is correct. Assuming exampleString is an std::string that has class scope like you describe, you ought to be able to initialize/assign it that way. Perhaps there is some other issue? Maybe a snippet of actual code would help put it in context.</p>

<p>Question: Is exampleString a pointer to a string object created with new?</p>

<p>Recently I have been having issues with Firefox 3 on Ubuntu Hardy Heron.</p>

<p>I will click on a link and it will hang for a while.  I don't know if its a bug in Firefox 3 or a page running too much client side JavaScript, but I would like to try and debug it a bit.</p>

<p>So, my question is "is there a way to have some kind of process explorer, or task manager sort of thing for Firefox 3?"</p>

<p>I would like to be able to see what tabs are using what percent of my processor via the JavaScript on that page (or anything in the page that is causing CPU/memory usage).  </p>

<p>Does anybody know of a plugin that does this, or something similar?  Has anyone else done this kind of inspection another way?</p>

<p>I know about FireBug, but I can't imagine how I would use it to finger which tab is using a lot of resources.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or insights?</p>

<p>It could be heap corruption, but it's just as likely to be stack corruption.  Jim's right.  We really need a bit more context.  Those two lines of source don't tell us much in isolation.  There could be any number of things causing this (which is the real joy of C/C++).</p>

<p>If you're comfortable posting your code, you could even throw all of it up on a server and post a link.  I'm sure you'd gets lots more advice that way (some of it undoubtedly unrelated to your question).</p>

<p>Your code as I can see has no errors. As has been said more context is needed.</p>

<p>If you haven't already tried, install gdb (the gcc debugger) and compile the program with -g. This will compile in debugging symbols which gdb can use. Once you have gdb installed run it with the program (gdb ). <a href="http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~cs331/gdbtutorial.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a useful cheatsheat for using gdb.</p>

<p>Set a breakpoint for the function that is producing the bug, and see what the value of exampleString is. Also do the same for whatever parameter you are passing to exampleString. This should at least tell you if the std::strings are valid.</p>

<p>I found the answer from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5727/understanding-pointers">this article</a> to be a good guide about pointers.</p>

<p>Oh, if you want to know how to debug the problem, that's simple.  First, get a dead chicken.  Then, <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?VoodooChickenCoding">start shaking it</a>.</p>

<p>Seriously, I haven't found a consistent way to track these kinds of bugs down.  Because there's so many potential problems, there's not a simple checklist to go through.  However, I would recommend the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get comfortable in a debugger.</li>
<li>Start tromping around in the debugger to see if you can find anything that looks fishy.  Check especially to see what's happening during the <code>exampleString = hello;</code> line.</li>
<li>Check to make sure it's actually crashing on the <code>exampleString = hello;</code> line, and not when exiting some enclosing block (which could cause destructors to fire).</li>
<li>Check any pointer magic you might be doing.  Pointer arithmetic, casting, etc.</li>
<li>Check all of your allocations and deallocations to make sure they are matched (no double-deallocations).</li>
<li>Make sure you aren't returning any references or pointers to objects on the stack.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are lots of other things to try, too.  I'm sure some other people will chime in with ideas as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, I actually fixed the std::string problem. How? By replacing it with a vector, compiling, then replacing the string again. It was consistently crashing there, and that fixed even though it...couldn't. There's something nasty there, and I'm not sure what.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like you really did shake a chicken at it.  If you don't know <em>why</em> it's working now, then it's still broken, and pretty much guaranteed to bite you again later (after you've added even more complexity).</p>

<p>It's probably the <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2008/05/25/fsyncers-and-curveballs/" rel="nofollow">awesome firefox3 fsync "bug"</a>, which is a giant pile of fail.</p>

<p>In summary</p>

<ul>
<li>Firefox3 saves its bookmarks and history in an SQLite database</li>
<li>Every time you load a page it writes to this database several times</li>
<li>SQLite cares deeply that you don't lose your bookmarks, so each time it writes, instructs the kernel to flush it's database file to disk and ensure that it's fully written</li>
<li>Many variants of linux, when told to flush like that, flush EVERY FILE. This may take up to a minute or more if you have background tasks doing any kind of disk intensive stuff.</li>
<li>The kernel makes firefox wait while this flush happens, which locks up the UI.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some places to start:</p>

<p>If you're on windows, and using visual C++6 (I hope to god nobody still uses it these days) it's implentation of std::string is not threadsafe, and can lead to this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Run Purify.</p>

<p>It is a near-magical tool that will report when you are clobbering memory you shouldn't be touching, leaking memory by not freeing things, double-freeing, etc.</p>

<p>It works at the machine code level, so you don't even have to have the source code.</p>

<p>One of the most enjoyable vendor conference calls I was ever on was when Purify found a memory leak in their code, and we were able to ask, "is it possible you're not freeing memory in your function foo()" and hear the astonishment in their voices.</p>

<p>They thought we were debugging gods but then we let them in on the secret so they could run Purify before we had to use their code. :-)</p>

<p>The cell location is an attached property - the value belongs to the TextBlock rather than Grid. However, since the property itself belongs to Grid, you need to use either the property definition field or the provided static functions.</p>

<pre><code>TextBlock tb = new TextBlock();
//
// Locate tb in the second row, third column.
// Row and column indices are zero-indexed, so this
// equates to row 1, column 2.
//
Grid.SetRow(tb, 1);
Grid.SetColumn(tb, 2);

<p>I want to create a client side mail creator web page. I know the problems of using the mailto action in an html form (not standard, no default mail appication set on the client). But the web page isn't very important, and they don't care very much.</p>

<p>The mail created by the mailto action has the syntax:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>subject: undefined subject<br>
  body:</p>
  
  <p>param1=value1<br>
  param2=value2<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  paramn=valuen  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can I use JavaScript to format the mail like this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Subject:XXXXX</p>
  
  <p>Body:
  Value1;Value2;Value3...ValueN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use attached properties of the Grid class.</p>

<p>in C#:    </p>

<pre><code>Grid.SetRow( cell, rownumber )</code></pre>

<p>In XAML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBlock Grid.Row="1" /&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Also, I would advice if you do not use dynamic grids, use the XAML markup language. I know, it has a learning curve, but once you mastered it, it is so much easier, especially if you are going to use ControlTemplates and DataTemplates! ;)</p>

<p>First of all, I know how to build a Java application. But I have always been puzzled about where to put my classes. There are proponents for organizing the packages in a strictly domain oriented fashion, others separate by tier.</p>

<p>I myself have always had problems with a) with naming, b) with placing</p>

<ol>
<li>Where do you put your domain specific constants (and what is the best name for such a class)?</li>
<li>Where do you put classes for stuff which is both infrastructural and domain specific (for instance I have a FileStorageStrategy class, which stores the files either in the database, or alternatively in database)?</li>
<li>Where to put Exceptions?</li>
<li>Are there any standards to which I can refer?</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there a reason you can't just send the data to a page which handles sending the mail?  It is pretty easy to send an email in most languages, so unless there's a strong reason to push it to client side, I would recommend that route.</p>

<p>Class names should always be descriptive and self-explanatory. If you have multiple domains of responsibility for your classes then they should probably be refactored.</p>

<p>Likewise for you packages. They should be grouped by domain of responsibility. Every domain has it's own exceptions.</p>

<p>Generally don't sweat it until you get to a point where it is becoming overwhelming and bloated. Then sit down and don't code, just refactor the classes out, compiling regularly to make sure everything works. Then continue as you did before.</p>

<p>I would second the recommendation for <a href="http://pcre.org" rel="nofollow" title="Jonathan Livingston Seagull">PCRE</a>. I have used it in C++ projects in Windows and it works great. It's free, even for building commercial software. It also implements something of a de facto standard regular expression language, which will be welcome to your users. PCRE is of course Perl-compatible, and Python also uses the same library.</p>

<p>The native PCRE interface is a bit awkward and very C-style, so it's probably worth writing a nice C++ wrapper around it. There is very likely already is one out there, but I'm not familiar with any.</p>

<p>You more or less only have two alternatives when sending mail via the browser..</p>

<ol>
<li>make a page that takes user input, and allows them to send the mail via your web-server. You need some kind of server-side scripting for this.</li>
<li>use a mailto: link to trigger opening of the users registered mail client. This has the obvious pitfalls you mentioned, and is less flexible. It needs less work though.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the debugging techniques that I use frequently (except in cases of the most extreme weirdness) is to divide and conquer. If your program currently fails with some specific error, then divide it in half in some way and see if it still has the same error. Obviously the trick is to decide where to divide your program!</p>

<p>Your example as given doesn't show enough context to determine where the error might be. If anybody else were to try your example, it would work fine. So, in your program, try removing as much of the extra stuff you didn't show us and see if it works then. If so, then add the other code back in a bit at a time until it starts failing. Then, the thing you just added is probably the problem.</p>

<p>Note that if your program is multithreaded, then you probably have larger problems. If not, then you should be able to narrow it down in this way. Good luck!</p>

<p>With javascript alone, it's <strong>not possible</strong>.<br />
Javascript is not intended to do such things and is severely crippled in the way it can interact with anything other than the webbrowser it lives in, (for good reason!).  </p>

<p>Think about it: a spammer writing a website with client side javascript which will automatically mail to thousands of random email addresses. If people should go to that site they would all be participating in a distributed mass mailing scam, with their own computer... no infection or user interaction needed!</p>

<p>Searching for some sample code for converting a point in WGS84 coordinate system to a map position in Google Maps (pixel position), also supporting zoom levels. </p>

<p>If the codes is well commented, then it can also be in some other language.</p>

<p>You can also point me to a open source Java project :)</p>

<p>Some resources found:</p>

<p><a href="http://trac.openlayers.org/browser/trunk/openlayers/lib/OpenLayers/Layer" rel="nofollow">OpenLayer</a> implementation. </p>

<p><a href="http://josm.openstreetmap.de/browser/trunk/src/org/openstreetmap/josm/data/projection" rel="nofollow">JOSM</a> project</p>

<p>Excellent <a href="https://github.com/OSUCartography/JMapProjLib" rel="nofollow">Java Map Projection Library </a> from JH LABS. This is a pure java PROJ.4 port. Does projection from WGS84 to meters. From there it's quite straightforward to convert meters to tile pixels.</p>

<p>I am wrapping existing C++ code from a BSD project in our own custom wrapper and I want to integrate it to our code with as few changes as possible. This code uses <code>fprintf</code> to print to <strong>stderr</strong> in order to log / report errors.</p>

<p>I want to redirect this to an alternative place within the same process. On Unix I have done this with a socketpair and a thread: one end of the socket is where I send <strong>stderr</strong> (via a call to <code>dup2</code>) and the other end is monitored in a thread, where I can then process the output.</p>

<p>This does not work on windows though because a socket is not the same as a file handle.</p>

<p>All documents I have found on the web show how to redirect output from a child process, which is not what I want.  How can I redirect <strong>stderr</strong> within the same process getting a callback of some sort when output is written?  (and before you say so, I've tried <code>SetStdHandle</code> but cannot find any way to make this work)...</p>

<p>You can use a similar technique on Windows, you just need to use different words for the same concepts. :) This article: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682499.aspx uses a win32 pipe to handle I/O from another process, you just have to do the same thing with threads within the same process. Of course, in your case all output to stderr from anywhere in the process will be redirected to your consumer.</p>

<p>Actually, other pieces of the puzzle you may need are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dye30d82(VS.80).aspx"><em>fdopen</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bdts1c9x(VS.71).aspx"></em>open_osfhandle</a>. In fact, here's a related example from some <a href="http://hewgill.com/pilot/copilot/">code</a> I released years ago:</p>

<pre><code>DWORD CALLBACK DoDebugThread(void *)
{
    AllocConsole();
    SetConsoleTitle("Copilot Debugger");
    // The following is a really disgusting hack to make stdin and stdout attach
    // to the newly created console using the MSVC++ libraries. I hope other
    // operating systems don't need this kind of kludge.. :)
    stdout-&gt;_file = _open_osfhandle((long)GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), _O_TEXT);
    stdin-&gt;_file  = _open_osfhandle((long)GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE), _O_TEXT);
    debug();
    stdout-&gt;_file = -1;
    stdin-&gt;_file  = -1;
    FreeConsole();
    CPU_run();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the main process was a GUI process which doesn't start with stdio handles at all. It opens a console, then shoves the right handles into stdout and stdin so the debug() function (which was designed as a stdio interactive function) can interact with the newly created console. You should be able to open some pipes and do the same sort of thing to redirect stderr.</p>

<p><a href="http://geotools.codehaus.org/" rel="nofollow">GeoTools</a> has code to transform to and from about any coordinate system you could imagine, and among them also Google Map's. It's also open source. However, it should also be pointed out that GeoTools is a <strong>large</strong> library, so if you're looking something small, quick and easy, it's likely not the way to go.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend it though if you're going to do other GIS/coordinate transformations, etc. as well.</p>

<p>If you use GeoTools or something similar, you might also be interested in knowing that the Google Map coordinate system is called EPSG 3785.</p>

<p>What is the best way to verify/test that a text string is serialized to a byte array with a certain encoding?</p>

<p>In my case, I want to verify that an XML structure is serialized to a byte array with the UTF-8 encoding which is of variable character length. As an example, my current ugly procedure is to inject a character known to require two bytes into the structure before serializing, then replacing the two-byte character with an ASCII character and comparing the serialized array lengths. This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.</p>

<p>Plus if the solution is elegant for Java. 
I can't think of any elegant way to seek for a byte sequence in a byte array. (Could be used to seek for a known byte sequence representing the desired character representation in UTF-8.)</p>

<p>You have to remember that what MSVCRT calls "OS handles" are not Win32 handles, but another layer of handles added just to confuse you. MSVCRT tries to emulate the Unix handle numbers where <code>stdin</code> = 0, <code>stdout</code> = 1, <code>stderr</code> = 2 and so on. Win32 handles are numbered differently and their values always happen to be a multiple of 4. Opening the pipe and getting all the handles configured properly will require getting your hands messy. Using the MSVCRT source code and a debugger is probably a requirement.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could deserialise the byte array using a known encoding and ensure that (a) it doesn't throw any exceptions, and (b) deserialises to the original string. It seems that from your description of the scenario, you may not have the original string readily available. Might there be a way to create it?</p>

<p>I would recommend in first teaching the very basics that are used in almost every language, but doing so without a language. Outline all the basic concepts If-Else If-Else, Loops, Classes, Variable Types, Structures, etc. Everything that is the foundation of most languages. Then move onto really understanding Boolean, comparisons and complex AND OR statements, to get the feeling on what the outcomes are for more complex statements. </p>

<p>By doing it this way he will understand the concepts of programming and have a much easier time stepping into languages, from there its just learning the intricate details of the languages,  its functions, and syntax.</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, the idea is to get a different "singleton" object for each caller object or "context".
One thing you can do is to create a thread-local global variable where you write the ID of the current context. (This can be done with AOP.) Then in the singleton getter, the context ID is fetched from the thread-local to use as a key to the correct "singleton" instance for the calling context. </p>

<p>Regarding AOP there should be no problem using it in applets since, depending on your point-cuts, the advices are woven at compile time and a JAR is added to the runtime dependencies. Hence, no special evidence of AOP should remain at run time.</p>

<p>Is there any way to capture the MouseDown even from the .NET 2.0 TextBox control?
I know the inherited Control class has the event, but it's not exposed in TextBox.
Is there a way to override the event handler?</p>

<p>I also tried the OpenNETCF TextBox2 control which does have the MouseDown event exposed, but no matter what I do, it doesn't fire the handler.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>What kind of crazy mobile device do
  you have that has a mouse? :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, windows mobile does not have an actual mouse, but you are mistaken that Windows Mobile .NET does not support the Mouse events.  A click or move on the screen is still considered a "Mouse" event.  It was done this way so that code could port over from full Windows easily.  And this is not a Windows Mobile specific issue.  The TextBox control on Windows does not have native mouse events either.  I just happened to be using Windows Mobile in this case.</p>

<p>Edit:  And on a side note...as Windows Mobile is built of the WindowsCE core which is often used for embedded desktop systems and Slim Terminal Services clients or "WinTerms" it has support for a hardware mouse and has for a long time.  Most devices just don't have the ports to plug one in.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the .Net Framework, the
  MouseDown Event Handler on a TextBox
  is supported. What happens when you
  try to run the code?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, that's only there because it inherits it from "Control", as does <em>every</em> other Form control.  It is however, overridden (and changed to private I believe) in the TextBox class.  So it will not show up in IntelliSense in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>However, you actually can write the code:</p>

<pre><code>textBox1.MouseDown += new System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventHandler(this.textBox1_MouseDown);
</code></pre>

<p>and it will compile and run just fine, the only problem is that textBox1_MouseDown() will not be fired when you tap the TextBox control.  I assume this is because of the Event being overridden internally.  I don't even want to change what's happening on the event internally, I just want to add my own event handler to that event so I can fire some custom code as you could with any other event.</p>

<p>I am writing an application in Java for the desktop using the Eclipse SWT library for GUI rendering.  I think SWT helps Java get over the biggest hurdle for acceptance on the desktop: namely providing a Java application with a consistent, responsive interface that looks like that belonging to any other app on your desktop.  However, I feel that packaging an application is still an issue.  </p>

<p>OS X natively provides an easy mechanism for wrapping Java apps in native application bundles, but producing an app for Windows/Linux that doesn't require the user to run an ugly batch file or click on a .jar is still a hassle.  Possibly that's not such an issue on Linux, where the user is likely to be a little more tech-savvy, but on Windows I'd like to have a regular .exe for him/her to run.</p>

<p>Has anyone had any experience with any of the .exe generation tools for Java that are out there?  I've tried JSmooth but had various issues with it.  Is there a better solution before I crack out Visual Studio and roll my own?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I should perhaps mention that I am unable to spend a lot of money on a commercial solution.</p>

<p>As mentioned d will be <code>IEnumerable&lt;MyProduct&gt;</code> while f is <code>List&lt;MyProduct&gt;</code></p>

<p>The conversion is done by the C# compiler</p>

<pre><code>var d = 
    from mp in MyProducts
    where mp.Price &lt; 50d
    select mp;
</code></pre>

<p>Is converted to (before compilation to IL and with generics expanded):</p>

<pre><code>var d = 
    MyProducts.
    Where&lt;MyProduct&gt;( mp =&gt; mp.Price &lt; 50d ).
    Select&lt;MyProduct&gt;( mp =&gt; mp ); 
    //note that this last select is optimised out if it makes no change
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in this simple case it makes little difference.  Where Linq becomes really valuable is in much more complicated loops. </p>

<p>For instance this statement could include group-bys, orders and a few let statements and still be readable in Linq format when the equivalent <code>.Method().Method.Method()</code> would get complicated.</p>

<p>My favourite "start learning to code" project is the Game <strong>Snakes</strong> or <strong>Tron</strong> because it allows you to start slow (variables to store the current "worm position", arrays to store the worm positions if the worm is longer than one "piece", loops to make the worm move, if/switch to allow the user to change the worm's direction, ...). It also allows to include more and more stuff into the project in the long run, e.g. object oriented programming (one worm is one object with the chance to have two worms at the same time) with inheritance (go from "Snakes" to "Tron" or the other way around, where the worm slightly changes behavior).</p>

<p>I'd suggest that you use <a href="http://creators.xna.com/" rel="nofollow" title="Power-Coder">Microsoft's XNA</a> to start. In my experience starting to program is much more fun if you can see something on your screen, and XNA makes it really easy to get something moving on the screen. It's quite easy to do little changes and get another look, e.g. by changing colors, so he can see that his actions have an effect -> Impression of success. Success is fun, which is a great motivation to keep on learning.</p>

<p>If you choose to throw a NPE and you are using the argument in your method, it might be redundant and expensive to explicitly check for a null. I think the VM already does that for you.</p>

<p>I have read through several reviews on Amazon and some books seem outdated.  I am currently using MyEclipse 6.5 which is using Eclipse 3.3.  I'm interested in hearing from people that have experience learning RCP and what reference material they used to get started.</p>

<p>I read the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321334612" rel="nofollow" title="Presentation Zen">book</a> suggested by Thomas and it's really worth reading, although not very up-to-date.</p>

<p>According to the .Net Framework, the <a href="http://www.csharpfriends.com/quickstart/aspplus/samples/classbrowser/cs/classbrowser.aspx?assembly=System.Windows.Forms,%20Version=1.0.5000.0,%20Culture=neutral,%20PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089&amp;namespace=System.Windows.Forms&amp;class=TextBox" rel="nofollow">MouseDown Event Handler on a TextBox</a> is supported. What happens when you try to run the code?</p>

<p>Fair enough. You probably know more than I do about Windows Mobile. :) I just started programming for it. But in regular WinForms, you can override the OnXxx event handler methods all you want. A quick look in Reflector with the CF shows that Control, TextBoxBase and TextBox don't prevent you from overriding the OnMouseDown event handler.</p>

<p>Have you tried this?:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyTextBox : TextBox
{
    public MyTextBox()
    {
    }

    protected override void OnMouseDown(MouseEventArgs e)
    {
        //do something specific here
        base.OnMouseDown(e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like you're right. Bummer. No MouseOver event.</p>

<p>One of the fallbacks that always works with .NET, though, is P/Invoke. Someone already took the time to do this for the .NET CF TextBox. I found this on CodeProject:</p>

<p>No you cannot get the MAC address in JavaScript, mainly because the MAC address uniquely identifies the running computer so it would be a security vulnerability.</p>

<p>Now if all you need is a unique identifier, I suggest you create one yourself using some cryptographic algorithm and store it in a cookie.</p>

<p>If you really need to know the MAC address of the computer AND you are developing for internal applications, then I suggest you use an external component to do that: ActiveX for IE, XPCOM for Firefox (installed as an extension).</p>

<p>Daniel's and Eldila's answer have one problem: They remove all quotes and commas in the whole file.</p>

<p>What I usually do when I have to do something like this is to first replace all separating quotes and (usually) semicolons by tabs. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Search:</em> ";"</li>
<li><em>Replace:</em> \t</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I know in which column my affected values will be I then do another search and replace:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Search:</em> ^([\t]+)\t([\t]+)\t([0-9]+),([0-9]+)\t</li>
<li><em>Replace:</em> \1\t\2\t\3\4\t</li>
</ul>

<p>... given the value with the comma is in the third column.</p>

<p>You need to start with an "^" to make sure that it starts at the beginning of a line. Then you repeat ([0-9]+)\t as often as there are columns that you just want to leave as they are.</p>

<p>([0-9]+),([0-9]+) searches for values where there is a number, then a comma and then another number.</p>

<p>In the replace string we use \1 and \2 to just keep the values from the edited line, separating them with \t (tab). Then we put \3\4 (no tab between) to put the two components of the number without the comma right after each other. All values after that will be left alone.</p>

<p>If you need your file to have semicolon to separate the elements, you then can go on and replace the tabs with semicolons. However then - if you leave out the quotes - you'll have to make sure that the text values do not contain any semicolons themselves. That's why I prefer to use TAB as column separator.</p>

<p>I usually do that in an ordinary text editor (EditPlus) that supports RegExp, but the same regexps can be used in any programming language.</p>

<p>I'm working on bringing some old code from 1998 up to the 21st century.  One of the first steps in the process is converting the printf statements to <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qstring.html" rel="nofollow">QString</a> variables.  No matter how many times I look back at printf though, I always end up forgetting one thing or the other.  So, for fun, let's decode it together, for ole' times sake and in the process create the first little <strong>'printf primer'</strong> for Stackoverflow.</p>

<p>In the code, I came across this little gem,</p>

<pre><code>printf("%4u\t%016.1f\t%04X\t%02X\t%1c\t%1c\t%4s", a, b, c, d, e, f, g);
</code></pre>

<p>How will the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g be formatted?</p>

<p>a. decimal, four significant digits </p>

<p>b. Not sure</p>

<p>c. hex, minimum 4 characters </p>

<p>d. Also hex, minimum 2 characters </p>

<p>e. 1 character </p>

<p>f. String of characters, minimum 4</p>

<p>I am working on a project right now that involves receiving a message from another application, formatting the contents of that message, and sending it to a printer.  Technology of choice is C# windows service.  The output could be called a report, I suppose, but a reporting engine is not necessary.  A simple templating engine, like StringTemplate, or even XSLT outputting HTML would be fine.  The problem I'm having is finding a free way to print this kind of output from a service.  Since it <em>seems</em> that it will work, I'm working on a prototype using Microsoft's RDLC, populating a local report and then rendering it as an image to a memory stream, which I will then print.  Issues with that are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-page printing will be a big headache.</li>
<li>Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream, which is unsupported in a Windows Service (though it may work - haven't gotten that far with the prototype yet)</li>
<li>If the data coming across changes, I have to change the dataset, and the class that the data is being deserialized into.  bad bad bad.</li>
</ul>

<p>Has anyone had to do anything remotely like this?  Any advice?  I already posed a question about printing HTML without user input, and after wasting about 3 days on that, I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be done, at least not with any freely available tool.</p>

<p>All help is appreciated.</p>

<p>EDIT: We are on version 2.0 of the .NET framework.</p>

<p>I'm using the .NETCF (Windows Mobile) <code>Graphics</code> class and the <code>DrawString()</code> method to render a single character to the screen.</p>

<p>The problem is that I can't seem to get it centered properly. No matter what I set for the Y coordinate of the location of the string render, it always comes out lower than that and the larger the text size the greater the Y offset.</p>

<p>For example, at text size 12, the offset is about 4, but at 32 the offset is about 10.</p>

<p>I want the character to vertically take up most of the rectangle it's being drawn in and be centered horizontally. Here's my basic code. <code>this</code> is referencing the user control it's being drawn in.</p>

<pre><code>Graphics g = this.CreateGraphics();

float padx = ((float)this.Size.Width) * (0.05F);
float pady = ((float)this.Size.Height) * (0.05F);

float width = ((float)this.Size.Width) - 2 * padx;
float height = ((float)this.Size.Height) - 2 * pady;

float emSize = height;

g.DrawString(letter, new Font(FontFamily.GenericSansSerif, emSize, FontStyle.Regular),
            new SolidBrush(Color.Black), padx, pady);

<p>Yes, I know there is the label control that I could use instead and set the centering with that, but I actually do need to do this manually with the <code>Graphics</code> class.</p>

<p>My command does remove all ',' and '"'.</p>

<p>In order to convert the sting "1,000" more strictly, you will need the following command.</p>

<p>I personally think that chapter from <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/xml_processing/index.html" rel="nofollow" title="The Subversion Book: Repository hooks">Dive into Python</a> is great. Check that out first - it uses the minidom module and is a pretty good piece of writing.</p>

<p>The new extensions in .Net 3.5 allow functionality to be split out from interfaces.</p>

<p>For instance in .Net 2.0</p>

<pre><code>public interface IHaveChildren {
    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }

    List&lt;IChild&gt; GetChildren()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can (in 3.5) become:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IHaveChildren {
    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }
}

public static class HaveChildrenExtension {
    public static List&lt;IChild&gt; GetChildren( this IHaveChildren ) {
        //logic to get children by parent type and id
        //shared for all classes implementing IHaveChildren 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to me to be a better mechanism for many interfaces.  They no longer need an abstract base to share this code, and functionally the code works the same. This could make code more maintainable and easier to test.</p>

<p>The only disadvantage being that an abstract bases implementation can be virtual, but can that be worked around (would an instance method hide an extension method with the same name? would it be confusing code to do so?)</p>

<p>Any other reasons not to regularly use this pattern?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Clarification:</p>

<p>Yeah, I see the tendency with extension methods is to end up with them everywhere. I'd be particularly careful having any on .Net value types without a great deal of peer review (I think the only one we have on string is a <code>.SplitToDictionary()</code> - similar to <code>.Split()</code> but taking a key-value delimiter too)</p>

<p>I think there's a whole best practice debate there ;-)</p>

<p>(Incidentally: DannySmurf, your PM sounds scary.)</p>

<p>I'm specifically asking here about using extension methods where previously we had interface methods.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I'm trying to avoid lots of levels of abstract base classes - the classes implementing these models mostly already have base classes. I think this model could be more maintainable and less overly-coupled than adding further object hierarchies.</p>

<p>Is this what MS have done to IEnumerable and IQueryable for Linq?</p>

<p>One problem I can see is that, in a large company, this pattern could allow the code to become difficult (if not impossible) for anyone to understand and use. If multiple developers are constantly adding their own methods to existing classes, separate from those classes (and, God help us all, to BCL classes even), I could see a code base spinning out of control rather quickly.</p>

<p>Even at my own job, I could see this happening, with my PM's desire to add every bit of code that we work on to either the UI or the data access layer, I could totally see him insisting on 20 or 30 methods being added to System.String that are only tangentially-related to string handling.</p>

<p>To draw a centered text:</p>

<pre><code>TextRenderer.DrawText(g, "my text", Font, Bounds, ForeColor, BackColor, 
  TextFormatFlags.HorizontalCenter | 
  TextFormatFlags.VerticalCenter |
  TextFormatFlags.GlyphOverhangPadding);
</code></pre>

<p>Determining optimal font size to fill an area is a bit more difficult. One working soultion I found is trial-and-error: start with a big font, then repeatedly measure the string and shrink the font until it fits. </p>

<pre><code>Font FindBestFitFont(Graphics g, String text, Font font, 
  Size proposedSize, TextFormatFlags flags)
{ 
  // Compute actual size, shrink if needed
  while (true)
  {
    Size size = TextRenderer.MeasureText(g, text, font, proposedSize, flags);

    // It fits, back out
    if ( size.Height &lt;= proposedSize.Height &amp;&amp; 
         size.Width &lt;= proposedSize.Width) { return font; }

    // Try a smaller font (90% of old size)
    Font oldFont = font;
    font = new Font(font.FontFamily, (float)(font.Size * .9)); 
    oldFont.Dispose();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'd use this as:</p>

<pre><code>Font bestFitFont = FindBestFitFont(g, text, someBigFont, sizeToFitIn, flags);
// Then do your drawing using the bestFitFont
// Don't forget to dispose the font (if/when needed)
</code></pre>

<p>@jj33, you're absolutely right, on both counts.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char *s = "Hello, World";
    char *s2 = "he";

    printf("4s: '%4s'\n", s);
    printf(".4s: '%.4s'\n", s);
    printf("4s2: '%4s'\n", s2);
    printf(".4s2: '%.4s'\n", s2);

    return 0;
}

$ gcc -o foo foo.c
$ ./foo
4s: 'Hello, World'
.4s: 'Hell'
4s2: '  he'
.4s2: 'he'
</code></pre>

<p>Good catch!</p>

<p>Through a combination of the suggestions I got, I came up with this:</p>

<pre><code>    private void DrawLetter()
    {
        Graphics g = this.CreateGraphics();

        float width = ((float)this.ClientRectangle.Width);
        float height = ((float)this.ClientRectangle.Width);

        float emSize = height;

        Font font = new Font(FontFamily.GenericSansSerif, emSize, FontStyle.Regular);

        font = FindBestFitFont(g, letter.ToString(), font, this.ClientRectangle.Size);

        SizeF size = g.MeasureString(letter.ToString(), font);
        g.DrawString(letter, font, new SolidBrush(Color.Black), (width-size.Width)/2, 0);

    }

    private Font FindBestFitFont(Graphics g, String text, Font font, Size proposedSize)
    {
        // Compute actual size, shrink if needed
        while (true)
        {
            SizeF size = g.MeasureString(text, font);

            // It fits, back out
            if (size.Height &lt;= proposedSize.Height &amp;&amp;
                 size.Width &lt;= proposedSize.Width) { return font; }

            // Try a smaller font (90% of old size)
            Font oldFont = font;
            font = new Font(font.Name, (float)(font.Size * .9), font.Style);
            oldFont.Dispose();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So far, this works flawlessly.</p>

<p>The only thing I would change is to move the FindBestFitFont() call to the OnResize() event so that I'm not calling it every time I draw a letter.  It only needs to be called when the control size changes.  I just included it in the function for completeness.</p>

<p>Here is a good case for regular expressions.  You can run a find and replace on the data either before you import (easier) or later on if the SQL import accepted those characters (not nearly as easy).  But in either case, you have any number of methods to do a find and replace, be it editors, scripting languages, GUI programs, etc.  Remember that you're going to want to find and replace <em>all</em> of the bad characters.</p>

<p>A typical regular expression to find the comma and quotes (assuming just double quotes) is: <em>(Blacklist)</em></p>

<pre><code>/[,"]/
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you find something might change in the future, this regular expression, matches anything except a number or decimal point. <em>(Whitelist)</em></p>

<pre><code>/[^0-9\.]/
</code></pre>

<p>What has been discussed by the people above is that we don't know all of the data in your CSV file.  It sounds like you want to remove the commas and quotes from all of the numbers in the CSV file.  But because we don't know what else is in the CSV file we want to make sure that we don't corrupt other data.  Just blindly doing a find/replace could affect other portions of the file.</p>

<p>The accepted practice if to use the <em>IllegalArgumentException( String message )</em> to declare a parameter to be invalid and give as much detail as possible... So to say that a parameters was found to be null while exception non-null, you would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if( variable == null )
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("The object 'variable' cannot be null");
</code></pre>

<p>You have virtually no reason to implicitly use the "NullPointerException". The NullPointerException is an exception thrown by the Java Virtual Machine when you try to execute code on null reference (Like <em>toString()</em>).</p>

<p>The solution to the changed question is basically the same.</p>

<p>You will have to run select query with the regex where clause.</p>

<p>Somthing like</p>

<pre><code>Select *
  FROM SOMETABLE
  WHERE SOMEFIELD REGEXP '"(\d+),(\d+)"'
</code></pre>

<p>Foreach of these rows, you want to do the following regex substitution s/"(\d+),(\d+)"/$1$2/ and then update the field with the new value.</p>

<p>Please Joseph Pecoraro seriously and have a backup before doing mass changes to any files or databases. Because whenever you do regex, you can seriously mess up data if there are cases that you have missed.</p>

<p>I'm using Pylons (a python framework) to serve a simple web application, but it seems to die from time to time, with this in the error log: <code>(2006, 'MySQL server has gone away')</code></p>

<p>I did a bit of checking, and saw that this was because the connections to MySQL were not being renewed. This shouldn't be a problem though, because the <code>sqlalchemy.pool_recycle</code> in the config file should automatically keep it alive. The default was <code>3600</code>, but I dialed it back to <code>1800</code> because of this problem. It helped a bit, but <code>3600</code> <em>should</em> be fine according to the docs. The errors still happen semi-regularly. I don't want to lower it too much though and DOS my own database :).</p>

<p>Maybe something in my MySQL config is goofy? Not sure where to look exactly.</p>

<p>Other relevant details:</p>

<pre><code>  Python 2.5
  Pylons: 0.9.6.2 (w/ sql_alchemy)
  MySQL: 5.0.51
</code></pre>

<p><strong>@Hugo regarding threadlocal:</strong></p>

<p>I thought about that solution. However, from experiments I found two problems with that approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shared thread (server connections, etc) are problematic. This can be solved though by paying special attention to these thread (they're all under my control and are pretty much isolated from the legacy code).</li>
<li>The EDT thread is shared across all applets. I failed to find a way to force the creation of a new EDT thread for each applet. This means that the threadlocal for the EDT would be shared across the applets. This one I have no idea how to solve. Suggestions?</li>
</ol>

<p>My guess here is that because the data was able to import that the field is actually a varchar  or some character field, because importing to a numeric field might have failed.  Here was a test case I ran purely a MySQL, SQL solution.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The table is just a single column (alpha) that is a varchar.</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; desc t;


+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| alpha | varchar(15) | YES  |     | NULL    |       | 
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add a record</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; insert into t values('"1,000,000"');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)


mysql&gt; select * from t;


+-------------+
| alpha       |
+-------------+
| "1,000,000" | 
+-------------+
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Update statement.</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; update t set alpha = replace( replace(alpha, ',', ''), '"', '' );
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0


mysql&gt; select * from t;


+---------+
| alpha   |
+---------+
| 1000000 | 
+---------+
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>So in the end the statement I used was:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table
   SET field_name = replace( replace(field_name, ',', ''), '"', '' );
</code></pre>

<p>I looked at the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-functions.html#function_replace">MySQL Documentation</a> and it didn't look like I could do the regular expressions find <em>and replace</em>.  Although you could, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7917/remove-quotes-and-commas-from-a-string-in-mysql#8135">Eldila</a>, use a regular expression for a find and then an alternative solution for replace.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Also be careful with <code>s/"(\d+),(\d+)"/$1$2/</code> because what if the number has more then just a single comma, for instance "1,000,000" you're going to want to do a global replace (in perl that is <code>s///g</code>). But even with a global replace the replacement starts where you last left off (unless perl is different), and would miss the every other comma separated group.  A possible solution would be to make the first (\d+) optional like so <code>s/(\d+)?,(\d+)/$1$2/g</code> and in this case I would need a second find and replace to strip the quotes.</p>

<p>Here are some ruby examples of the regular expressions acting on just the string "1,000,000", notice there are NOT double quote inside the string, this is just a string of the number itself.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; "1,000,000".sub( /(\d+),(\d+)/, '\1\2' )
# =&gt; "1000,000"  
&gt;&gt; "1,000,000".gsub( /(\d+),(\d+)/, '\1\2' )
# =&gt; "1000,000"  
&gt;&gt; "1,000,000".gsub( /(\d+)?,(\d+)/, '\1\2' )
# =&gt; "1000000"  
&gt;&gt; "1,000,000".gsub( /[,"]/, '' )
# =&gt; "1000000"  
&gt;&gt; "1,000,000".gsub( /[^0-9]/, '' )
# =&gt; "1000000"
</code></pre>

<p>I think we are going to go the third party route.  I like the XSL -> HTML -> PDF -> Printer flow... Winnovative's <a href="http://www.winnovative-software.com/" rel="nofollow" title="Cocoa Programming for Mac OSX">HTML to PDF</a> looks good for the first part, but I'm running into a block finding a good PDF printing solution... any suggestions?  Ideally the license would be on a developer basis, not on a deployed runtime basis.</p>

<p>At my work we are running a group of tests that consist of about 3,000 separate test cases. Previously we were running this entire test suite on one machine, which took about 24-72 hours to complete the entire test run. We now have created our own system for grouping and distributing the tests among about three separate machines and the tests are prioritized so that the core tests get run first for more immediate results and the extra tests run when there is an available machine.</p>

<p>I am curious if anyone has found a good way to distribute their tests among several machines to reduce total test time for a complete run and what tools were used to achieve that. I've done some research and it looks like TestNG is <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000362.html" rel="nofollow">moving in this direction</a>, but it looks like it is still under quite a bit of development. </p>

<p>We don't plan on rewriting any of our tests, but as we add new tests and test new products or add-ons I'd like to be able to deal with the fact that we are working with very large numbers of tests. On the other hand, if we can find a tool that would help distribute our Junit <code>3.x</code> tests even in a very basic fashion, that <em>would</em> be helpful since we wouldn't have to maintain our own tooling to do that.</p>

<p>I've seen some people having a play with <a href="http://216.93.179.140:8080/wiki/display/GG15UG/Distributed+JUnit+Overview" rel="nofollow">distributed JUnit</a>. I can't particularly vouch for how effective it is, but the other teams I've seen seemed to think it was straight forward enough. Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Printing from a service is a bad idea. Network printers are connected "per-user". You can mark the service to be run as a particular user, but I'd consider that a bad security practice. You might be able to connect to a local printer, but I'd still hesitate before going this route.</p>

<p>The best option is to have the service store the data and have a user-launched application do the printing by asking the service for the data. Or a common location that the data is stored, like a database. </p>

<p>If you need to have the data printed as regular intervals, setup a Task event thru the Task Scheduler. Launching a process from a service will require knowing the user name and password, which again is bad security practice.</p>

<p>As for the printing itself, use a third-party tool to generate the report will be the easiest.</p>

<p>I need to prevent <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Fixation">Session Fixation</a>, a particular type of session hijacking, in a Java web application running in JBoss. However, it appears that the standard idiom <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Fixation_in_Java">doesn't work in JBoss</a>. Can this be worked around?</p>

<p>Unless you want to do something a little complex, using the generic views are the way to go.  They are far more powerful than their name implies, and if you are just displaying model data generic views will do the job.</p>

<p><a href="https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JBAS-4436">This defect</a> (found <a href="http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=54688">here</a>) points the way to the solution. The Tomcat instance that runs in JBoss is configured with emptySessionPath="true", rather than "false", which is the default. This can be modified in <code>.../deploy/jboss-web.deployer/server.xml</code>; both the HTTP and AJP connectors have this option.</p>

<p>The feature itself is used to eliminate the context path (eg. "foo" in <a href="http://example.com/foo">http://example.com/foo</a>) from being included in the JSESSIONID cookie. Setting it to false will break applications that rely on cross-application authentication, which includes stuff built using some portal frameworks. It didn't negatively affect the application in question, however.</p>

<p>You could try setting up your own python installation using <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#creating-a-virtual-python" rel="nofollow">Virtual Python</a>.  Check out how to setup Django using it <a href="http://forums.site5.com/showthread.php?t=10236" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  That was written a long time ago, but it shows how I got MySQLdb setup without having root access or anything like it.  Once you've got the basics going, you can install any python library you want.</p>

<p>One thing I've done in the past - if I'm extending a class I'll try and follow their conventions. For example, when working with the Spring Framework, I'll have my MVC Controller classes in a package called com.mydomain.myapp.web.servlet.mvc
If I'm not extending something I just go with what is simplest. com.mydomain.domain for Domain Objects (although if you have a ton of domain objects this package could get a bit unwieldy).
For domain specific constants, I actually put them as public constants in the most related class. For example, if I have a "Member" class and have a maximum member name length constant, I put it in the Member class. Some shops make a separate Constants class but I don't see the value in lumping unrelated numbers and strings into a single class. I've seen some other shops try to solve this problem by creating SEPARATE Constants classes, but that just seems like a waste of time and the result is too confusing. Using this setup, a large project with multiple developers will be duplicating constants all over the place.</p>

<p>Imagine an object you are working with has a collection of other objects associated with it, for example the Controls collection on a WinForm.  You want to check for a certain object in the collection, but the collection doesn't have a <code>Contains()</code> method.  There are several ways of dealing with this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement your own <code>Contains()</code> method by looping through all items in the collection to see if one of them is what you are looking for. This seems to be the "best practice" approach.</li>
<li>I recently came across some code where instead of a loop, there was an attempt to access the object inside a try statement, as follows:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>try  
{  
    Object aObject = myCollection[myObject];  
}  
catch(Exception e)  
{  
    //if this is thrown, then the object doesn't exist in the collection
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is how poor of a programming practice do you consider the second option be and why?  How is the performance of it compared to a loop through the collection?</p>

<p>If, while writing your code, you expect this object to be in the collection, and then during runtime you find that it isn't, I would call that an exceptional case, and it is proper to use an exception.</p>

<p>However, if you're simply testing for the existence of an object, and you find that it is not there, this is not exceptional. Using an exception in this case is not proper.</p>

<p>The analysis of the runtime performance depends on the actual collection being used, and the method if searching for it. That shouldn't matter though. Don't let the illusion of optimization fool you into writing confusing code.</p>

<p>In general, using exception handling for program flow and logic is bad practice. I personally feel that the latter option is unacceptable use of exceptions. Given the features of languages commonly used these days (such as Linq and lambdas in C# for example) there's no reason not to write your own Contains() method.</p>

<p>As a final thought, these days most collections <em>do</em> have a contains method already. So I think for the most part this is a non-issue.</p>

<p>The general rule of thumb is to avoid using exceptions for control flow unless the circumstances that will trigger the exception are "exceptional" -- e.g., extremely rare!</p>

<p>If this is something that will happen normally and regularly it definitely should not be handled as an exception.</p>

<p>Exceptions are very, very slow due to all the overhead involved, so there can be performance reasons as well, if it's happening often enough.</p>

<p>I like break my classes down into packages that are related to each other.</p>

<p>For example:
<strong>Model</strong> For database related calls</p>

<p><strong>View</strong> Classes that deal with what you see</p>

<p><strong>Control</strong> Core functionality classes</p>

<p><strong>Util</strong> Any misc. classes that are used (typically static functions)</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>I think keep it simple and don't over think it. Don't over abstract and layer too much. Just keep it neat, and as it grows, refactoring it is trivial. One of the best features of IDEs is refactoring, so why not make use of it and save you brain power for solving problems that are related to your app, rather then meta issues like code organisation.</p>

<p>Using Microsoft Visual Studio 98, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 SP6</p>

<p>When running under the debugger, there's only one problem.  If I pause the program and resume, everything's fine.</p>

<p>The problem?  When I hit a breakpoint, my program stops.  But not in a good way; execution halts, I'm thrown out of debug mode into edit mode.  All's fine until a breakpoint is hit.  And I know it's hitting the breakpoint - I see a flash of the little yellow arrow pointing at the right line of code, local variables in the inspect window and the call stack in that window.  And then I'm staring at the editor.</p>

<p>This happens in all projects.</p>

<p>I've uninstalled and re-installed MSVC6.  It didn't help.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Note: MSVC6 is not my choice, but there are reasons.  It's the tool I work with.  And, we get to target NT4, so given 2008 can't target NT4 and 2005 has issues with MFC and NT4, MSVC6 it is.</p>

<p>I want to create an allocator which provides memory with the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>cannot be paged to disk.    </li>
<li>is incredibly hard to access through an attached debugger</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is that this will contain sensitive information (like licence information) which should be inaccessible to the user. I have done the usual research online and asked a few other people about this, but I cannot find a good place start on this problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8451/secure-memory-allocator-in-c#27194">Josh</a> mentions using VirtualAlloc to set protection on the memory space.

<p>What you are asking for is handled at the OS level.  Once the data is in your program, it is liable to be paged out.</p>

<p>For accessing the memory, a motivated individual can attach a hardware debugger.</p>

<p>Let's take this a bit at a time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to create an allocator which
  provides memory with the following
  attributes:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's fair enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>* cannot be paged to disk.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>That's going to be hard. As far as I am aware, you cannot disable Virtual Paging as it is handled by the OS. If there is a way, then you'll be spelunking in the bowels of the OS.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>* is incredibly hard to access through an attached debugger
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You could run it through PGP and store it encrypted in memory and unencrypt it as needed. Massive performance hit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea is that this will contain
  sensitive information (like licence
  information) which should be
  inaccessible to the user. I have done
  the usual research online and asked a
  few other people about this, but I
  cannot find a good place start on this
  problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep all sensitive information off the machine. Seriously. Don't store sensitive information in memory. Write a custom delete routine that will automatically remove all data from any allocations you perform. Never allow general access to a machine with sensitive material on it. If you perform db access, make sure all access is sanitized before firing. Only people with specific log-ins are allowed to access. No general group access.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a side note, what other methods are
  there of accessing the memory of a
  process other than attaching a
  debugger?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking a dump of the memory.</p>

<p>@graham</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could run it through PGP and store it encrypted in memory and unencrypt it as needed. Massive performance hit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you'd have to hold the key in memory.  That would make it a little harder, but definitely not impossible.  Anyone motivated will still manage to get the data from memory.</p>

<p>Stop beating on VC6. It's old. The STL was updated in 1996 from HP code written in 1994. C++ was ratified in 1998.</p>

<p>What is the code doing when you are breaking? Can you reduce the situation into a simple test. When I try that I usually find the cause. If you can do that so it still happens then I'll take a look at it for you. I too am unfortunate enough to use VC6 for my day to day work.</p>

<p>Extension methods should be used as just that: extensions. Any crucial structure/design related code or non-trivial operation should be put in an object that is composed into/inherited from a class or interface. </p>

<p>Once another object tries to use the extended one, they won't see the extensions and might have to reimplement/re-reference them again.</p>

<p>The traditional wisdom is that Extension methods should only be used for:</p>

<ul>
<li>utility classes, as Vaibhav mentioned</li>
<li>extending sealed 3rd party APIs</li>

<p>First off, this is a question about a desktop application using Windows Forms, not an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> question.</p>

<p>I need to interact with controls on other forms. I am trying to access the controls by using, for example, the following...</p>

<pre><code>otherForm.Controls["nameOfControl"].Visible = false;
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't work the way I would expect. I end up with an exception thrown from <code>Main</code>. However, if I make the controls <code>public</code> instead of <code>private</code>, I can then access them directly, as so...</p>

<pre><code>otherForm.nameOfControl.Visible = false;
</code></pre>

<p>But is that the best way to do it? Is making the controls <code>public</code> on the other form considered "best practice"? Is there a "better" way to access controls on another form?</p>

<p><strong>Further Explanation:</strong></p>

<p>This is actually a sort of follow-up to another question I asked, <em><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3725/best-method-for-creating-a-tree-view-preferences-dialog-type-of-interface-in-c">Best method for creating a tree-view preferences dialog type of interface in C#?</a></em>. The answer I got was great and solved many, many organizational problems I was having in terms of keeping the UI straight and easy to work with both in run-time and design-time. However, it did bring up this one niggling issue of easily controlling other aspects of the interface.</p>

<p>Basically, I have a root form that instantiates a lot of other forms that sit in a panel on the root form. So, for instance, a radio button on one of those sub-forms might need to alter the state of a status strip icon on the main, root form. In that case, I need the sub-form to talk to the control in the status strip of the parent (root) form. (I hope that makes sense, not in a "who's on first" kind of way.)</p>

<p>I personally would recommend <em>NOT</em> doing it... If it's responding to some sort of action and it needs to change its appearance, I would prefer raising an event and letting it sort itself out...</p>

<p>This kind of coupling between forms always makes me nervous. I always try to keep the UI as light and <em>independent</em> as possible..</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Perhaps you could expand on the scenario if not?</p>

<p>Ouch. Please don't extend Interfaces.<br />
An interface is a clean contract that a class should implement, and your usage of said classes <strong>must</strong> be restricted to what is in the core Interface for this to work correctly.</p>

<p>That is why you always declare the interface as the type instead of the actual class.</p>

<pre><code>IInterface variable = new ImplementingClass();
</code></pre>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>If you really need a contract with some added functionality, abstract classes are your friends.</p>

<p>I would handle this in the parent form.  You can notify the other form that it needs to modify itself through an event.</p>

<p>Instead of making the control public, you can create a property that controls its visibility:</p>

<pre><code>public bool ControlIsVisible
{
     get { return control.Visible; }
     set { control.Visible = value; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a proper accessor to that control that won't expose the control's whole set of properties.</p>

<p>The first is not working of course. The controls on a form are private, visible only for that form by design.</p>

<p>To make it all public is also not the best way.</p>

<p>If I would like to expose something to the outer world (which also can mean an another form), I make a public property for it.</p>

<pre><code>public Boolean nameOfControlVisible
{
    get { return this.nameOfControl.Visible; }
    set { this.nameOfControl.Visible = value; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can use this public property to hide or show the control or to ask the control current visibility property:</p>

<pre><code>otherForm.nameOfControlVisible = true;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also expose full controls, but I think it is too much, you should make visible only the properties you really want to use from outside the current form.</p>

<pre><code>public ControlType nameOfControlP
{
    get { return this.nameOfControl; }
    set { this.nameOfControl = value; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Do your child forms really need to be Forms?  Could they be user controls instead?  This way, they could easily raise events for the main form to handle and you could better encapsulate their logic into a single class (at least, logically, they are after all classes already).</p>

<p>@Lars:  You are right here.  This was something I did in my very beginning days and have not had to do it since, that is why I first suggested raising an event, but my other method would really break any semblance of encapsulation.</p>

<p>@Rob: Yup, sounds about right :).  0/2 on this one...</p>

<p>Maybe you should take a look at <a href="http://izpack.org/" rel="nofollow" title="for Visual Studio 2005">IzPack</a>. I created a very nice installer some years ago and I'd bet that they are still improving it. It allows the installation of docs, binaries and a clickable link to start the application <em>IIRC</em>.</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend a good binary XML format? It's for a JavaME application, so it needs to be a) Easy to implement on the server, and b) Easy to write a low-footprint parser for on a low-end JavaME client device.</p>

<p>And it goes without saying that it needs to be smaller than XML, and faster to parse.</p>

<p>Have you considered writing a small program in C/C++ that just calls <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>CreateProcess</code></a> to start up the java VM with the jar (or class) file?</p>

<p>We are looking for a WYSIWYG editor control for our windows application (vb.net or c#) so that users can design HTML emails (to send using the SMTP objects in the dot net framework) before sending.</p>

<p>Currently all the available editors we can find have one of the following issues:</p>

<p>a)They rely on mshtml.dll or the web browser control which as proven for us to be unreliable as the html code and the editor get out of sync under windows 2000  (IE6)</p>

<p>b)They are web based not a windows form control     </p>

<p>c)They place styles in the head of the document (see note below).</p>

<p>Unfortunately as this <a href="http://www.xavierfrenette.com/articles/css-support-in-webmail/" rel="nofollow">HTML email article</a> descries the only sure way of making HTML emails to work with styles is to use them inline which now seems to be unsupported in many editors.</p>

<p>Does any one have any experience in this or could suggest a solution?</p>

<p>I also needed a WYSIWYG editor for a Windows Forms project that I was working on. I wrote about the items that I found <a href="http://ellisweb.net/2007/03/wysiwyg-editing-of-html-in-a-windows-forms-control/" rel="nofollow" title="for Visual Studio 2005">here</a>. Eventually, I ended up using something that I found on CodeProject: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/edit/editor_in_windows_forms.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="for Visual Studio 2008">A Windows Forms based text editor with HTML output</a>. This does violate (a) above in that it uses the WebBrowser control. However, I couldn't find anything good that didn't do this (if you don't use the WebBrowser in some way, then you basically have to right your own HTML parser and renderer in order to handle the "What-You-See" part of WYSIWYG). The good thing about this control is that the source is easily customizable, so you can take away and add formatting options as you need (and if you want the styles to all be in-line, you can do this as well). </p>

<p>Another option I was considering: rather than writing a native launcher from scratch, Eclipse comes with the source code for its own launcher, and this could perhaps be repurposed for my app.</p>

<p>It's a shame that Sun never included anything similar in the JDK.</p>

<p>What kind of data are you planning to use? I would say, that if the server is also done in Java, easiest way for small footprint is to send/receive binary data in predefined format. Just write everything in known order into <code>DataOutputStream</code>.</p>

<p>But it would really depend, what what kind of data are you working on and can you define the format.</p>

<p>Actually you should evaluate, if this kind of optimization is even needed. Maybe you target devices are not <strong>so</strong> limited.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a c# snippet which I can insert in a Windows service. The code must empty the recycle bin for all users on the computer.</p>

<p>I have previously tried using <code>SHEmptyRecycleBin</code> (ref <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/Empty_Recycle_Bin.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/Empty_Recycle_Bin.aspx</a>) however the code doesn't work when ran from a windows service as the service is running with local system privileges.</p>

<p>I think doing something like this is against Microsoft recommended practices. What are you trying to do that requires emptying the Recycle Bin from a Windows service?</p>

<p>For a C# UserControl on Windows Mobile (though please answer if you know it for full Windows...it might work) how do you change what shows up in the Designer Properties window for one of the Control's public Properties.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>private Color blah = Color.Black;

public Color Blah
{
    get { return this.blah; }
    set { this.blah = value; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This shows up for the control, but it's in the "Misc" category and has no description or default value.  I've tried using the settings in System.ComponentModel like "DesignerCategory", such as:</p>

<pre><code>[DesignerCategory("Custom")]
</code></pre>

<p>But says this is only valid for class declarations... could've sworn it was the System.ComponentModel items I used before...</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>@John said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DesignerCatogy is used to say if the
  class is a form, component etc.</p>
  
  <p>Try this:</p>
  
  <p>[Category("Custom")]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a particular namespace I need to use in order to get those?
I've tried those exactly and the compiler doesn't recognize them.</p>

<p>In .NETCF all I seem to have available from System.ComponentModel is:</p>

<pre><code>DataObject,
DataObjectMethod,
DefaultValue,
DesignerCategory,
DesignTimeVisible,
EditorBrowsable
</code></pre>

<p>The only one it doesn't scream at is EditorBrowsable</p>

<p>What is the library? Is there a full implementation? How is the library used? Where is its website?</p>

<p>DesignerCatogy is used to say if the class is a form, component etc.</p>

<p>For full windows the attribute you want is:</p>

<p>[System.ComponentModel.Category("Custom")]</p>

<p>and for the description you can use [System.ComponentModel.Description("This is the description")] </p>

<p>to use both together</p>

<p>[System.ComponentModel.Category("Custom"),System.ComponentModel.Description("This is the description")]</p>

<p>However this is part of system.dll which may be different for windows mobile.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://lxml.de/">lxml package</a> supports xpath.  It seems to work pretty well, although I've had some trouble with the self:: axis.  There's also <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Amara/1.1.6">Amara</a>, but I haven't used it personally.</p>

<p>For business apps, Windows Forms is very mature. It provides a gentle path from auto-generating a lot for you into allowing fine-grained control and rolling your own.  There are tons of high-quality third party controls and a large body of examples, docs, etc out there. It's hard to run into a problem that someone else hasn't solved. I highly recommend acquiring some background Win32 knowledge (e.g. <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/index.html" rel="nofollow">Petzold</a>) as the WinForms framework lives on top of it.</p>

<p>I have no WPF experience, but from the sample apps I've seen it looks like a good choice for apps whose interfaces would benefit from more graphical metaphors. So if you're doing a banking app, probably not worth the extra design overhead. But if you're doing, say, a warehouse management app it could be improved by dropping pretty boxes into pretty bins.</p>

<p>@StephenCox: wrong answer to the wrong question. OP is asking about desktop client apps, and moreover, WPF != Silverlight.</p>

<p>I'm trying to rebuild an old metronome application that was originally written using <code>MFC</code> in C++ to be written in <code>.NET</code> using <code>C#</code>. One of the issues I'm running into is playing the midi files that are used to represent the metronome "clicks".</p>

<p>I've found a few articles online about playing <code>MIDI</code> in .NET, but most of them seem to rely on custom libraries that someone has cobbled together and made available.  I'm not averse to using these, but I'd rather understand for myself how this is being done, since it seems like it <em>should</em> be a mostly trivial exercise.</p>

<p>So, am I missing something?  Or is it just difficult to use MIDI inside of a .NET application?</p>

<p>Hopefully you can't.</p>

<p>A service running as the local machine should not be clearing my Recycle bin, ever.</p>

<p>You could promote the service to run as an Admin account then it would have the right (and be a security risk), but why do you want to do this? It sounds like the sort of think Viruses try to do.</p>

<p>I can't claim to know much about it, but I don't think it's that straightforward - Carl Franklin of <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2547864/msnetformattingstrings">DotNetRocks</a> fame has done a fair bit with it - have you seen <a href="http://dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showID=110" rel="nofollow" title="DNR TV">his DNRTV</a>?</p>

<p>First, have you tried running the service on an interactive user account? Maybe SHEmptyRecycleBin requires an interactive user even though it doesn't necessarily display a Window.</p>

<p>Second, I'm not sure it's a good idea to delete other users' stuff but I guess you have a very good reason?</p>

<p>So I've been poking around with C# a bit lately, and all the Generic Collections have me a little confused. Say I wanted to represent a data structure where the head of a tree was a key value pair, and then there is one optional list of key value pairs below that (but no more levels than these). Would this be suitable?</p>

<pre><code>public class TokenTree
{
    public TokenTree()
    {
        /* I must admit to not fully understanding this,
         * I got it from msdn. As far as I can tell, IDictionary is an
         * interface, and Dictionary is the default implementation of
         * that interface, right?
         */
        SubPairs = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
    }

    public string Key;
    public string Value;
    public IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt; SubPairs;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's only really a simple shunt for passing around data.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xfhwa508.aspx" rel="nofollow">Dictionary Class</a> is exactly what you want, correct.</p>

<p>You can declare the field directly as Dictionary, instead of IDictionary, but that's up to you.</p>

<p>There is a KeyValuePair built-in type. As a matter of fact, this is what the IDictionary is giving you access to when you iterate in it.</p>

<p>Also, this structure is hardly a tree, finding a more representative name might be a good exercise.</p>

<p>@<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/733/jay-mooney" rel="nofollow">Jay Mooney</a>: A generic Dictionary class in .NET is actually a hash table, just with fixed types.</p>

<p>The code you've shown shouldn't convince anyone to use Hashtable instead of Dictionary, since both code pieces can be used for both types.</p>

<p>For hashtable:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(object key in h.keys)
{
     string keyAsString = key.ToString(); // btw, this is unnecessary
     string valAsString = h[key].ToString();

     System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(keyAsString + " " + valAsString);
}
</code></pre>

<p>For dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(string key in d.keys)
{
     string valAsString = d[key].ToString();

     System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(key + " " + valAsString);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And just the same for the other one with KeyValuePair, just use the non-generic version for Hashtable, and the generic version for Dictionary.</p>

<p>So it's just as easy both ways, but Hashtable uses Object for both key and value, which means you will box all value types, and you don't have type safety, and Dictionary uses generic types and is thus better.</p>

<p>For a simple starting point to get your head around the "event-driven" nature basically all frameworks are created around look at <a href="http://www.fltk.org" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2547864/msnetformattingstrings">FLTK</a>.</p>

<p>For professional use I'd recommend Qt, expensive but often worth it in commercial situations.</p>

<p>Just one thing to add to this (although I do think you have already had your question answered by others). In the interests of extensibility (since we all know it will happen at some point) you may want to check out the <a href="http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternComposite.aspx" rel="nofollow">Composite Pattern</a> This is ideal for working with "Tree-Like Structures"..</p>

<p>Like I said, I know you are only expecting one sub-level, but this could really be useful for you if you later need to extend ^_^</p>

<p>I think what you might be after (as a literal implementation of you question) is:</p>

<pre><code>pubic class TokenTree
{
    public TokenTree()
    {
        tree = new Dictionary&lt;string, IDictionary&lt;string,string&gt;&gt;();
    }

    IDictionary&lt;string, IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; tree; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>You did actually say a "list" of key-values in your question so you might want to swap the inner IDictionary with a:</p>

<pre><code>IList&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;&gt;

<p>I wrote an application that currently runs against a local instance of MySql.  I would like to centralize the DB somewhere on the Net, and share my application.</p>

<p>But, I'm cheap, and don't want to pay for it.  Does anyone know of a free on-line relational DB service that I could connect to via C#?</p>

<p>Does anyone know <strong>IF</strong>, <strong>WHEN</strong> or <strong>HOW</strong> I can get <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/" rel="nofollow">Memcached</a> running on a Windows 64bit environment? </p>

<p>I'm setting up a new hosting solution and would much prefer to run a 64bit OS, and since it's an ASP.Net MVC solution with SQL Server DB, the OS is either going to be Windows Server 2003 or (hopfully!) 2008.</p>

<p>I know that this could spill over into a debate regarding 32bit vs 64bit on servers, but let's just say that my preference is 64bit and that I have some <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/mscom/archive/2005/09/26/411568.aspx" rel="nofollow">very</a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000435.html" rel="nofollow">good</a> reasons.</p>

<p>So far, I've tried a number of options and found a <a href="http://blog.rakeshxp.com/2007/09/running-memcached-on-windows.html" rel="nofollow">bit</a> of <a href="http://www.splinedancer.com/memcached-win32/" rel="nofollow">help</a> related to getting this up on a 32bit machine (and succeeded I might add), but since the original <a href="http://jehiah.cz/projects/memcached-win32/" rel="nofollow">Windows port</a> is Win32 specific, this is hardly going to help when installing as a service on x64. It also has a dependency on the <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/" rel="nofollow">libevent</a> for which I can only get a Win32 compiled version.</p>

<p>I suspect that simply loading all this up in C++ and hitting "compile" (for 64bit) wouldn't work, not least because of the intricate differences in 32 and 64bit architectures, but I'm wondering if anyone is workng on getting this off the ground? Unfortunately, my expertise lie in managed code (C#) only, otherwise I would try and take this on myself, but I can't believe I'm the only guy out there trying to get <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/" rel="nofollow">memcached</a> running on a 64 bit Windows server....am I??</p>

<p>Any help or recommendations appreciated...</p>

<hr>

<p>Update</p>

<p><strong>Yes I'm afraid I'm still looking for an answer to this - all my efforts (with my pathetic C++ skills) to make a stable build have failed - I've trashed one server and 3 VM's just trying it out so now I turn to the real experts.
Is anyone planning on porting this to 64bit? Or are you really suggesting that I use MS Velocity instead? I shudder at the thought...</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update:
@Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part.</p>

<p>@DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service. Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried.</p>

<p>@OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response. I thought as much, but wasn't sure if anyone else had suggestions or had already gone down this route. Maybe when StackOverflow is LIVE, then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into, and although I can try and compile it myself - I simply can't "trust" (with my C++ experience level) that it would provide "Enterprise Level" reliability in such a crucial component of large scalable solutions. I think it would need educated intervention rather than my unsanitised experimental approach before I could be confident. One little oversight on my part, could bring the site down. Oh well... till next time... </p>

<p>I've never heard of such a thing. A few years ago, many hosts (Brinkster, etc) offered some minimal database capacity with their free web hosting accounts, but I think you'd find it difficult to find something like that now. Even if you could, most hosts no longer allow you to connect to a database (even on an account you're paying for) outside of a web application running on their server.</p>

<p>My advice would be to cobble together an old computer and use that as a database server that you run out of your house (coupled with no-ip or some similar service, probably). If you're going to need more horsepower/bandwidth than that, you'll probably just have to suck it up and pay for something.</p>

<p>Have you taken a look at <a href="http://creator.zoho.com/" rel="nofollow">http://creator.zoho.com/</a>?<br />
I haven't tested it myself but it might be a good idea to check it out.</p>

<p>Oops, didn't read the question properly that time! :P</p>

<p>Haven't tried this yet, and their site says they had had a major crash recently, but it looks promising: <a href="http://www.freesql.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2547864/msnetformattingstrings"><a href="http://www.freesql.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freesql.org/</a></a></p>

<p>What about <a href="http://www.freesql.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.freesql.org</a> ?  Seems like you can't be too picky when you're asking for free, and this seems to offer something.</p>

<p>Are you sure that the 32-bit version doesn't just run on 64-bit Windows, without modification? Most things do.</p>

<p>Failing that, have you actually tried just compiling it for 64-bit? A brief scan of a few Google Groups etc where people asked this same question suggests that that may be exactly the solution to this. I think you're probably overestimating the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit Windows (at least as far as compiling a native application goes).</p>

<p>Sounds like you need <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SimpleDB-AWS-Service-Pricing/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=342335011" rel="nofollow">Amazon SimpleDB</a>...</p>

<p>It's not free, but pricing looks pretty good. I've not used it myself, but when I've got a bit of spare time I might use it for a project I'm working on.</p>

<p>What is the best way to retrieve mp3 metadata in python?  I've seen a couple frameworks out there, but I'm unsure as to which would be the best to use.... Any ideas?</p>

<p>We need to add WorkFlow to our Spring managed application. Does anyone have any useful experience in using any of the myriad of OSS Work Flow solutions? Which one is best? Which one integrates with Spring best? Which ones should we avoid?</p>

<p>A simple example from the book Dive Into Python works ok for me, <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/download/diveintopython-examples-5.4.zip" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the download link, the example is fileinfo.py. Don't know if it's the best, but it can do the basic job.</p>

<p>The entire book is available online <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>It can depend on exactly what you want to do in addition to reading the metadata. If it is just simply the bitrate / name etc. that you need, and nothing else, something lightweight is probably best.</p>

<p>If you're manipulating the mp3 past that PyMedia may be suitable.</p>

<p>There are quite a few, whatever you do get, make sure and test it out on plenty of sample media. There are a few different versions of ID3 tags in particular, so make sure it's not too out of date. </p>

<p>Personally I've used this small MP3Info class with luck. It is quite old though.</p>

<p>This came to my mind after I learned the following from <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/8941/generic-type-checking">this question</a>:</p>

<pre><code>where T : struct
</code></pre>

<p>We, C# developers, all know the basics of C#. I mean declarations, conditionals, loops, operators, etc.</p>

<p>Some of us even mastered the stuff like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/512aeb7t.aspx" rel="nofollow">Generics</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397696.aspx" rel="nofollow">anonymous types</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397687.aspx" rel="nofollow">lambdas</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397676.aspx" rel="nofollow">LINQ</a>, ...</p>

<p>But what are the most hidden features or tricks of C# that even C# fans, addicts, experts barely know?</p>

<p>"<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9k7k7cf0%28VS.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">yield</a>" would come to my mind. Some of the attributes like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.defaultvalueattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow">[DefaultValue()]</a> are also among my favorites.</p>

<p>The "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383973.aspx" rel="nofollow">var</a>" keyword is a bit more known, but that you can use it in .NET 2.0 applications as well (as long as you <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msbuild/archive/2006/11/03/msbuild-orcas-and-multi-targeting.aspx" rel="nofollow">use the .NET 3.5 compiler</a> and set it to output 2.0 code) does not seem to be known very well.</p>

<p>Edit: kokos, thanks for pointing out the ?? operator, that's indeed really useful. Since it's a bit hard to google for it (as ?? is just ignored), here is the MSDN documentation page for that operator: <em><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173224.aspx" rel="nofollow">?? Operator (C# Reference)</a></em></p>

<p>Honestly the experts by the very definition should know this stuff.  But to answer your question: <em><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ya5y69ds.aspx" rel="nofollow">Built-In Types Table (C# Reference)</a></em></p>

<p>The compiler flagging for numbers are widely known for these:</p>

<pre><code>Decimal = M
Float = F
Double = D

// for example
double d = 30D;
</code></pre>

<p>However these are more obscure:</p>

<pre><code>Long = L
Unsigned Long = UL
Unsigned Int = U
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't know the "as" keyword for quite a while.</p>

<pre><code>MyClass myObject = (MyClass) obj;
</code></pre>

<p>vs</p>

<pre><code>MyClass myObject = obj as MyClass;
</code></pre>

<p>The second will return null if obj isn't a MyClass, rather than throw a class cast exception.</p>

<ul>
<li>TransactionScope and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.transactions.dependenttransaction.aspx" rel="nofollow">DependentTransaction</a> in System.Transactions is a lightweight way to use transaction processing in .NET - it's not just for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229973.aspx" rel="nofollow">Database transactions either</a></li>
<li>String.IsNullOrEmpty is one that I am surprised to learn a lot of developers don't know about</li>
<li>List.ForEach - iterate through your generic list using a delegate method</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more, but that is the three obvious ones of the top of my head...</p>

<p>I have a base class that represents a database test in TestNG, and I want to specify that all classes extending from this class are of a group "db-test", however I have found that this doesn't seem possible.  I have tried the @Test annotation:</p>

<pre><code>@Test(groups = { "db-test" })
public class DBTestBase {
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this doesn't work because the @Test annotation will try to make a bunch of methods into tests, and warnings/errors pop up in eclipse when the tests are run.</p>

<p>So I tried disabling the test, so at least the groups are assigned:</p>

<pre><code>@Test(enabled = false, groups = { "db-test" })
public class DBTestBase {
}
</code></pre>

<p>but then any @BeforeTest (and other similar annotations) ALSO get disabled... which is of course not what I want.</p>

<p>I would like some way to annotate a class as being of a particular type of group, but it doesn't quite seem possible in TestNG.  Does anyone have any other ideas?</p>

<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.itwriting.com/htmleditor/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, which goes a little lower than the WebBrowser, but still uses MSHTML, which does spit out some ugly HTML. For my purposes, I am doing a multi-tabbed editor with WYSIWYG and HTML edit mode (using <a href="http://sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SD/" rel="nofollow">ICSharp.TextEditor</a>)  with a Buffer class to update whenever tabs change. As part of that Buffer class, I actually <a href="http://www.wynia.org/wordpress/2008/02/14/using-htmltidy-to-clean-up-html-with-c/" rel="nofollow">run the HTML through HTML Tidy</a> and a few scrub-n-replace bits to get valid XHTML.</p>

<p>I only offer that as a solution because I, too, failed to find one that wasn't derived from MSHTML in some way and eventually just went ahead with the above solution to keep moving forward.</p>

<p>I have often come across the need to have a generic parameter-object persisted into the viewstate in a base class.</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class BaseListControl&lt;ListType,KeyType,ParameterType&gt;
                 : UserControl 
                 where ListType : BaseListType
                 &amp;&amp; ParameterType : BaseParameterType, new
{

    private const string viewStateFilterKey = "FilterKey";

    protected ParameterType Filters
    {
        get
        {
            if (ViewState[viewStateFilterKey] == null)
                ViewState[viewStateFilterKey]= new ParameterType();

            return ViewState[viewStateFilterKey] as ParameterType;
        }
        set
        {
            ViewState[viewStateFilterKey] = value;
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>private void SomeEventHappened(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Filters.SomeValue = SomeControl.SelectedValue;
}

private void TimeToFetchSomeData()
{
    GridView.DataSource = Repository.GetList(Filters);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This little trick with the "where ParameterType : BaseParameterType, new" is what makes it really work.</p>

<p>With this property in my baseclass, I can automate handling of paging, setting filter values to filter a gridview, make sorting really easy, etc.</p>

<p>I am really just saying that generics can be an enormously powerful beast in the wrong hands.</p>

<p>Question for YUI experts...</p>

<p>I have a table and I've made each cell of the first row draggable by <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/dragdrop/dd-proxy.html" rel="nofollow" title="Virtual Workspaces">proxy</a>. In IE, when the drag proxy is released, the original table cell actually jumps to wherever the release point was. How can I prevent this from happening? Essentially, I want to know where the proxy was dropped and handle my logic from there but I don't want the original to move.</p>
